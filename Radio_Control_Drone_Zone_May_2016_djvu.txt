Drones on show... 

H aving just returned from a busy visit to this year's Nuremberg Toy Fair, the overriding impression is 
that drones hove certainly arrived with o bong and pretty much taken over the RC flying industry. 
Everywhere you looked at the Toy Fair there was o multi-rotor of some description os oil the major 
manufacturers, and plenty of new ones, jump on the drone success bandwagon. The industry is 
certainly developing fast with the established manufacturers developing and expanding their ranges 
while the new, mostly Far Eastern manufacturers, not only play catch up, but in some cases leapfrog the big brands 
with new ideas and designs. It's a very fast moving industry which is starting to divide into a few focused areas. 
There are plenty of lower end, beginner and toy type products which are still pretty high tech and will appeal to 
newcomers, and even these are split into sport, photography and aerobatic style. Then there are the mid-market 
products which are typically more expensive, but feature extra bells and whistles and again can be purchased for 
leisure flying, more serious aerial photography and video, aerobatics, including 3D flight, plus the new and exciting 
area of FPV quad racing. The third main group of products fall into the professional category and are mainly used 
for serious aerial photography and video, surveillance by the emergency services and even broadcast quality video 
for use by filmmakers and television production. 

All these sectors are doing well and enjoying huge increases in sales, so it's no wonder so many manufacturers 
want to grab a piece of the action. The only downside is due to their popularity and shear numbers out flying around, 
they are attracting the attention of the authorities and media. The news now all too often carries a story about a drone 
being misused, a near miss or crash into a building which doesn't do the industry any favours. I suppose when there 
is such a fast growth in something it's bound to attract some attention, but it's really down to us responsible enthusiasts 
to make sure drones are seen as a force for good and not evil. It's essential we only fly our drones in safe areas well 
away from buildings and people unless given the proper and appropriate authority to do so. 

In the USA the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has already taken steps to cut down on unauthorised drone use by 
making all pilots register and be properly licensed which seems like a sensible step. The organisation also provides 
plenty of useful advice for model aircraft, drone and UAV pilots. In the UK, the CAA and BMFA have launched a 
'Drone Aware' campaign and as part of the initiative April has been designated 'Drone Awareness Month'. There will 
be a high profile media launch and BMFA affiliated clubs will be encouraged to host Drone Aware events where new 
and existing drone operators will be able to attend and learn more about their responsibilities and also take a new 
voluntary proficiency certificate. You can find out more about the campaign online at www.droneaware.org and I'd 
encourage you to check it out, but above all, always make sure you fly safely.

MULTI-ROTOR AND DRONE NEWS STORIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD 



C hinese drone manufacturer, Ehang, has claimed 
a world first by building a drone capable of 
carrying a human passenger. Ehang unveiled 
its new 'Ehang 1 84 ' at the Las Vegas convention center 
during the CES gadget show earlier this year. 

In a company video showing the 1 84 flying (https:// 


EHANG UNVEILS HUMAN 
CARRYING DRONE 


youtu.be/lrPejpbz8RI), it looks like a small helicopter, 
but with eight propellers spinning parallel to the ground 
in a similar configuration to other drones. 

The electric-powered drone can be fully charged in 
two hours, carry up to 1 00kg (2201b) and fly for 23 
minutes at sea level, according to Ehang. The cabin fits 
one person and a small backpack and is fitted with air 
conditioning and a reading light. It is designed to fit, 
with propellers folded, in a single parking space. 

After setting a flight plan, passengers need only to 
give two commands - 'take off' and 'land' - done with 
a single click on a tablet, according to Ehang. 

The drone is designed to fly between 300 and 500 
metres (1 ,000 to 1 ,650 feet) from the ground with 
a maximum altitude of 3.5km (1 1 ,500 feet) and top 


speed of 63 mph (lOOkm/h). 

Derrick Xiong, the chief marketing officer, says the 
vehicle had been flown more than 100 times at low 
altitudes in a forested area in Guangzhou, including 
several times with a person aboard. 

A passenger would have no controls as a backup, 
he says. The company was planning a remote control 
centre that would take over the vehicle in the event of a 
problem and ensure it landed safely. 

One feature that makes the quadcopter safer than 
a helicopter is its numerous propellers, Xiong adds. 
Even if three of the four arms had their six propellers 
disabled, the final arm's working propellers could 
ensure a rough landing by spiralling towards 
the ground. 


DRONES CAN LAUNCH ANYTIME FROM ANYWHERE 


H 3 Dynamics has unveiled its new Dronebox 
product, a system that converges 
professional drone-enabled service 
activities with the Industrial Internet of 
Things (lloT), or what H3 Dynamics is 
calling the 'Internet of Drones'. 

Dronebox is an all-inclusive, self-powered system 
that can be deployed anywhere, including in remote 
areas where industrial assets, borders, or sensitive 
installations require constant monitoring. Designed as 


an evolution over today's many unattended sensors 
and CCTV cameras installed in cities, borders, or large 
industrial estates, Dronebox can give sensors freedom 
of movement using drones as their vehicles. End-users 
can now deploy flying sensor systems at different 
locations, and measure just about anything, anywhere, 
anytime. They offer 24/7 reactivity, providing critical 
information to operators - even to those located 
thousands of miles away. 

Dronebox can charge drone batteries automatically 


within its shelter system. Off-grid power is provided 
primarily by a solar-battery installation. For more 
advanced requirements, system capabilities can be 
extended using Remobox, an accessory that provides 
more advanced communications and hosts a small 
back-up fuel cell system for year long availability in 
mission critical locations.

DEVELOPINGTHE FUTURE 
OF DRONES IN MINING 

T echnological advancements in the development of 
drones may soon change some of the world's most 
dangerous and labour-intensive industries. Drones for 
mining have started to become a reality and make way for 
massive changes to the mining and energy industries. 

The use of drones in mining operations has the potential to 
allow the development of mines in regions of the world once 
thought too dangerous or too remote. Using drones for mining 
allows miners to monitor stockpiles, map exploration targets 
and track equipment. Eventually, using drones in mining will 
lead to package delivery to these remote worksites. 

Imagine creating the mines of the future in remote locations 
and being able to control operations from control rooms in 
America and Australia. With technological advancements in 
using drones in mining, the future will come sooner than 
you think. 

Drones in mining will allow the capture of 3D spatial data 
in hard-to-reach underground areas in mines, which removes 
many risks and safety concerns. Using drones in mining for 
underground mapping has a variety of other benefits as well, 
including being cost effective and easy on labor. 

The use of drones in mining environments holds a promising 
future. A company called Clickmox Solutions has developed 
a 3D mapping system that can be installed on drones and is 
capable of building 3D maps in real time without the need 
for a GPS signal for positioning. Underground mapping can 
occur with a 3D laser area scanner that is light enough to be 
carried by the drone without limiting flight time. 

Drones in mining environments are projected to have a 
major impact on the industry in terms of productivity, cost 
effectiveness, efficiency and safety. You can find out more 
about the use of drones in mining and other commercial uses 
by visiting the KDE Direct website at www.kdedirect.com

PARROT’S ORIGINAL BEBOP DRONE WAS AN ATTEMPT BYTHE FRENCH COMPANYTO AIM MORE TOWARDS THE 
PRO DRONE MARKET HOW HAS THIS VERSION 2 CHANGED?TOM STACEY TAKES A LOOK 


L ast year we looked at what was probably the 
most innovative flying product yet from Parrot - 
their (perhaps oddly named) Bebop Drone. The 
Bebop took everything that Parrot know about 
drones from their highly successful AR. Drone 
line, and did three things: First, they increased the 
camera's capabilities significantly, secondly, they 
improved the flight performance to match pro-level 
drones, and lastly, they reduced the size of the unit 
from the large and cumbersome dimensions of the 
AR. Drone to something more compact and purposeful 
in its design. 

THE BEBOP CONCEPT 

The original Bebop was o product that took the 'pro- 
level' drone design sheet and torn it up in exchange 


for their typically radical approach to design. Rather 
than the 'Sky crone' style looks of most quodcopters, 
the Bebop is compact and aggressive-looking, styled 
o little like the AR. Drone with the safety belt off, but for 
less goofy without the former's long nose. Again, rather 
than use o gimbol or fixed mount camera underneath 
the frame where it is susceptible to damage, here, the 
camera is front mounted, looking mostly forward, with 
o slight tilt down. Many would scoff at this idea os it 
of course only gives o fixed, narrow view forward, 
but they'd be wrong os Parrot cleverly equipped this 
camera with o very wide fish-eye lens which allowed 
the pilot to pan around the field of view in software, 
mimicking o steerable camera (albeit limited in its field 
of view still). The original Bebop was well received 
and its combination of opp-control via the Free Flight 


App for iOS and Android, and also the innovative 'Sky 
Controller' meant that it provided a high quality and 
interesting diversion from the drone norm for many 
buyers. 

INTRODUCING BEBOP 2 

Whilst it was definitely o different and mostly successful 
product, the Bebop wasn't without issues. An overage 
of 1 1 minutes battery time isn't competitive in this 
market, and the range issues with the Wi-Fi control on 
most phones and tablets meant it was not something 
you'd trust to send up and use for long-range aerial 
video missions. Whilst much of the Bebop 2 remains 
the some os its predecessor. Parrot hove thankfully 
nailed the battery life, and supposedly increased the 
Wi-Fi range to 300m on o phone or tablet too. Other 


:&gt; J 



detail changes are abound, but the big 
news is really the battery which now offers 
25 minutes of flight time - this is far more 
useful to anyone wishing to capture video 
of reasonable areas from reasonable 
altitude. 


MORE CHANGES ABOUND 



The main reason for the increase in flight 
time is the inclusion of a 2700mAh LiPo 
battery. This huge battery is physically 
larger and the whole lot weighs 1 OOg 
more than the original Bebop did. Also, 
Parrot have fitted a bright orientation LED 
below the 
battery 
interlock 
on the rear of the 
drone to help you see where 
it is when in the air. This is o very useful 
addition in our opinion. Round the front 
of the drone, where the characteristic 
nose mounted camera is. Parrot hove 
tweaked the setup o little too. Whereas 
before the camera was mounted in that 
expanded polystyrene material that the 
French company love to use, and this 
continued rearwards to moke up most 
of the body of the croft, now there is for 
less of the polystyrene and more thin red 
lexon which should prove less easy to 
damage. Speaking of the camera, this is 
still o 1 4MP fish-eye unit, but Parrot hove 
supposedly improved the quality from 
before. It's still only 1080P, not 4K, and 
won't compete with the best Go Pros and 



the like, but it should be pretty good for 
those graduating from o £1 50 drone, or 
something like the AR. Drone 

Other hardware changes include 
o simpler motor mounting system and 
thicker, one piece arms going out to 
them. The red and block design theme 
continues, which of course helps identify 
the props and the direction in which the 
croft is facing, but the '2' is more block 
than red now, lending to o stealth ier, more 
professional look (block and white is also 
available). Generally, this newer product 
feels more solid and better constructed, the 
added weight adding to this also. 

SOFTWARE CHANGES 

Parrot also claim to hove improved the 
software that runs the drone internally, 
with improvements to the stability of 
flight, os well os crosswind resistance. 

The neutral angle of the camera is now 
further downwards, and the drone 
con capture images at o 90-degree 
downward facing angle. There is now 
more image stabilisation in the software, 
which promises smoother footage, and 
os mentioned before Wi-Fi connection 
quality has been improved too using 
dual bond MIMO antennas and the latest 
protocol support to hong onto and moke 
connections more robustly. Parrot ore still 
clinging to 802. 1 1 Wi-Fi of course os o 
connection medium allowing smartphone 
and tablet control rather than o dedicated 
spread spectrum RC connection; how 


this fores in practice, os ever, remains to 
be seen. Bock to recording footage and 
again, the Bebop features 8Gb of on- 
board storage and no removable storage, 
which is o shame os it does fill up quickly, 
but at least you hove some storage to use 
out of the box, rather than having to buy 
on external drive. 

FREE FLIGHT APP 

Controlling your Bebop 2 drone is the 
some os before, and indeed the some 
os the rest of the range, from tiny rolling 
spider upwards, which is with the Free 
Flight 3 opp, available for iOS and 
Android platforms. It seems very simplistic 
at first, but in fact hides o multitude of 
functionality which con be extended 
further via in-opp purchases. An example 
of this is the planned route option which 
overlays satellite images with your chosen 
route for the drone to fly. Hit o button and 
off it goes on its travels, following the 
route you prescribed and powered by the 
inbuilt GPS/GLONASS receiver. Clever 
stuff, although it'd be nice to hove hod the 
functionality included for free on such o 
pricey piece of kit! 

Once you load up Free Flight, you're 
able to do o number of things - first 
of oil you con update the software on 
your drone or controller, which is worth 
checking before you fly (and doing if 
an update is available). You con also 
join the Parrot Drone Academy, o virtual 
online service where you con shore your

drone owners. It's great to be able to see flights from 
the other side of the world, and it did reinforce the fact 
that the Californian landscape is for more beautiful and 
interesting than semi-rurol Essex! Of course the most 
useful and interesting port of the opp is the piloting 
port, and this is where you con control the Bebop 2 
via onscreen controls that mimic o controller joystick. 

A take-off and landing button controls these functions 
automatically and carefully, whilst o further 'joystick' 
allows you to pan the camera around. An emergency 
button, which is o feature that dotes from the earliest 
AR. Drone software will cut the motors pretty sharply 
and down the drone wherever it is, so be careful of this 
area of the screen when flying! 

SKYCONTROLLER BLACK 

The package we hove here for review is the 'deluxe' 
version which includes the latest version of the 


Skycontroller hardware that was launched with the 
original Bebop. This Skycontroller Block is essentially 
the some os the previous version, but adopted for the 
larger batteries of the Bebop 2. As before, it uses the 
some battery os the flight battery in the drone and you 
get on extra one in the box, os well os o stand-alone 
charger for the batteries. 

In cose you're unfamiliar with the Skycontroller, it is 
o stand-alone joystick type controller for use exclusively 
with the Bebop 2, and features proper gimboi mounted 
sticks and o neck strop like o traditional RC controller. 
The sticks ore mounted quite for opart though, and 
the reason for this is so you con mount o smartphone 
or tablet between the sticks to stream bock video and 
provide greater control than the controller itself. iPhones 
and Android phones (only fairly recent ones though) 
and iPod 2, 3, 4, Mini and Airs ore oil supported, in 
addition to most recent Android tablets. You con also 
use the controller on its own without o mobile device 


too os it provides on embedded version of the Free 
Flight logic itself. As well os physical sticks, perhaps 
the biggest advantage of using the controller is in the 
extra range it provides thanks to o massive aerial array 
on top of the device. When using the Skycontroller the 
range increases from 300m to 2000m which mokes this 
drone for more useful and reliable. 

Another interesting element that the Skycontroller 
offers is support for FPV goggles, and even the Occulus 
Rift via on HDMI and USB out. During our time with 
the Bebop's Skycontroller, we didn't manage to get 
on opportunity to try it FPV, but this video on YouTube 
shows the kind of possibilities that ore available with 
the product in conjunction with Occulus Rift (www. 
youtube. com/wotch?v=pAAhlVAPGhU). 

WHO'S IT FOR? 

When thinking about this product, you can't help but 
try and understand what the target market is for it. Of 



I

course, the AR. Drone was a breakthrough product 
that brought easy to fly, pre-assembled, larger 
drones to the consumer market, and also provided 
the very innovative Wi-Fi App-control to fly it. The 
latter aspect was a very interesting one as it meant 
you had the controller in your pocket already, and 
you already knew how to use it (if you knew how 
to use a smartphone of course). In the years since 
the AR. Drone was released though, easy to fly, 
assembled drones of this size are everywhere, and 
whilst AR. Drone still offers that easy to control, easy 
to live with approach, it looks increasingly alone 
for its price. The Bebop 1 and 2 of course have 
attempted to counter this by offering everything the 
AR. Drone offers, and the unique 'Parrotness' of a 
premium, consumer, Apple Store friendly product. 

To be fair to them, they definitely succeed on this 
accessibility front and the product feels very very 
professional in terms of its construction, packaging, 
support and availability. At £439, it's expensive, but 
you do feel you get your money's worth with it and 
the quality of construction is worthy of the price. At 
£759 though with the Skycontroller, you start think 
that it is very definately aiming at the likes of the DJIs 
of this world which in terms of capability for aerial 
video offer more quality and usability. Again, you 
see where your money went with Parrot, but are you 
spending it on the right things? It's a tricky one, and 
for many buyers, having something so easy to get 
working that offers reliable results is a big plus. For 
the drone pilot who knows RC and knows their way 
around getting the best from a product that perhaps 
doesn't offer the same level of support and easy of 
use, then maybe the traditional pro level drone would 
be a better fit. It's a debate that will rage on for sure. 

WHAT COMES IN THE BOX? 

The Bebop Drone comes in a lovely box, but what 
do you get in it? Well, one drone is obvious, but 
perhaps less obvious is the complete spare pair of 
propellers and assembly tool which is a nice bonus. 
The charger for the included battery has adaptors 
for worldwide use, and Parrot also include a printed 
paper getting started manual which is also nice. Step 
up to the Skycontroller bundle and you'll get all the 
above, and the controller (of course!) in addition to 
an extra battery, a sunshade for the controller and 
a neckstrap as well as a further printed guide for 
the controller. It's all really nicely done and you'd 
walk out of the shop thinking you got your money's 
worth with the substantial and good looking package 
you're holding. 

ON TEST 

As with all these things, the test day that we were 
constrained to using (in February!) which was bright 
enough to take any kind of photos was also right 
in the middle of Sorm Imogen which decided that 
Rotorworld review day was an excellent day to 
choose to batter the British Isles. According to our 
(also created a French Tech company) Netatmo 
wind gauge, the gusts were up in the 40mph range, 
and consistent winds were running from 1 8-20mph! 
Parrot had promoted the fact that the Bebop 2 was 
better at coping with cross winds, so the proof was 
to be in the flying in these conditions. The first test 
was to be with the Free Flight app and no controller. 


O 

The same 
battery 
is shared 
between 
controller 
and drone 


and having some familiarity with the software from 
our Rolling Spider, we felt comfortable getting going 
with an iPhone 6S Plus straight away. The Bebop 2 
was set to auto-takeoff, which it did using that same 
familiar, controlled algorithm that is common among 
the whole range and settled into a four foot hover in 
front of the pilot. Rather than the joypad type control, 
the app-based controller was set to the traditional 
accelerometer controls which seems the most natural 
and involve the least amount of finger movement. 
Those of you more familiar with an AR. Drone will be 
amazed by how much better the quality of images 
coming through from the front mounted camera is 
straight away, and in the short range we tested the 
Bebop 2 within, the quality of the video remained 
excellent throughout. An interesting feature is that, 
using the drone's inbuilt GPS, you can set a return 
point if there are no user inputs for a set time period 
(say 60 seconds). We tried out the feature, and it 
worked flawlessly, so assuming there are 
no obstacles in the return path, it could 
prove very useful in case of your 
phone crashing, running out of 
battery, or network connectivity 


THE SKYCONTROLLER 
IN ACTION 

As we had the setup that 
included the Skycontroller, it 
felt rude not to try it out too. 

Rather than add the preferred 
option of a tablet, we used the sa 
iPhone 6S Plus as before and in sume 
ways this would be our favoured approach 
due to the combination of reduced weight 
a reasonably large screen. One thina 
is for sure - if you use an iPad 4, 1 
whole setup is VERY heavy, even 
with a neckstrap. We'd find 
that most users might prefer 
something like a plastic 7" 
tablet that gives a reasonable 
size screen, but keeps the 
weight down. It's personal 
preference at the end of the 
day, so your mileage may vary. 


Rather than turning the drone on and connecting 
your phone to the Wi-Fi network it creates, when 
using the controller, you connect your phone to the 
controller's Wi-Fi network, after letting the controller 
connect to the drone. If this process seems confusing, 
then worry not, as it is defined clearly in the getting 
started guide in the box. The controller also gives a 
visible feedback via LEDs of the battery state of the 
controller and drone and the signal strength and 
the rapidness in which you can do this is certainly 
more reassuring during flight. The controller features 
mappable, hardware buttons for controlling the 
drone and its features, and so, rather than pressing 
the screen, take-off is instigated by a button and 
this makes is very easy to do quickly compared to 
fiddling around on a screen. Once in the air as well, 
using the proper hardware sticks makes it far easier 
to fly and control. A dedicated joystick for panning 
the camera is also provided and makes 
this very simple to do smoothly. 

IN THE AIR 

In the air, the Bebop 2 
feels very similar to an 
AR. Drone, only faster 
and more resistant to 
cross winds. In fact, 
this is one of the most 
stable drones in the 
price range we've 
tested. Certainly it holds 
osition very very well, 
like its fellow family 
!rs, it can struggle at 
times holding altitude on tricky 
urfaces in wind outdoors. The camera 
'\y fun addition and works 
For the most part, being 
course limited a little 
by its fixed orientation, 
even when you take 
into account the fact 
it can pan around 
within its 1 80 degree 
vision. As said before, 
it's also fast, and 
we'd suggest limiting 


Proper, gimbal mounted sticks make all the difference to control

FINAL THOUGHTS 

As you'd expect from Parrot, this is an interesting 
product, and one that definitely builds on the success 
of its predecessor(s) . It's high quality and simple to use, 
but hides a really wide range of capabilities. It is also 
quite simple for the most part in its construction and 
that should make it cheaper and simpler to fix if you 


drone on its own, it's a really compelling option, with 
compact dimensions and a very high quality feel, but 
it is a bit limited by the app control which is really only 
as good as the control offered on their sub £100 mini 
drones. Add the controller to the mix and you're talking 
a lot more money, but it can do a lot lot more. In many 
ways, it's nice that Parrot do offer this option, and it'll 
be interesting to see which does better on the market.#

Here come the drones 


YET ANOTHER YEAR HAS PASSED ANDTHE DRONE ZONE 
MAGAZINETEAM HAS TRAVELLED TO NUREMBERG, GERMANY 
TOVISITTHE MOST IMPORTANTTOY FAIR IN EUROPETHE 
SPIELWARENMESSE.THIS ISTHE PLAGETO SEETHE LATEST 
RELEASES AND NEW PRODUGTS FROM THE MOST REGOGNISED 
BRANDS IN THE INDUSTRYTHAT USETHIS FAIRTO SHOW OFF 
THEIR LATEST INNOVATIONS AND MEET NEW AND EXISTING 
GUSTOMERS AND OF GOURSETHETRADE PRESS. OVERTHE NEXT 
FEW PAGES WETAKE YOU ON ATOUR OFTHIS YEAR’S SHOW... 


O ver the last few years we've witnessed 
a massive growth in the popularity of 
multi-rotors at the Nuremberg Toy Fair 
and this year saw the biggest influx of 
new drone brands and models ever. This has been 
to the detriment of RC helicopters and the truth is that 
this year RC helicopters and related new products and 
accessories were o little thin on the ground to say the 
least. When walking around the fair, we also noticed 


A trend we've seen developing over the lost few 
years is o growth in the number of exhibitors from 
Chino with toy like RC products. This year even more 
Chinese companies were exhibiting stands, with over 
60 per cent of exhibitors representing Chinese brands. 
Multi-rotors, drones, or whatever you wont to coll them, 
hove stomped oil over the market and it was difficult to 
find o stand that didn't hove some form of multi-rotor 
machine on it. For Drone Zone readers and the fans of 


information about what they will be displaying online 
before the show, so there ore less surprises for us. Still, 
it wasn't oil doom and gloom, it was still on exciting 
and vibrant show with drone fans particularly well 
catered for this year. It also provides on annual get 
together for the industry to not only show products and 
meet customers, but also network and shore ideas. So 
here's our overview of what was on show and worth 
looking at this year... ■ 


fewer visitors than in previous years, with many stands 
looked pretty empty at times. This was also reflected 
in the amount of well known names exposing their 
brands, such os Optifuel/Opti power, Freokwore/Align, 
Castle Creations and even the bigger brands like DJI 
and Florizon Flobby which hod smaller stands than in 
previous years. 


these aircraft it was definitely on interesting show. 

In short, there were only o few highlights and new 
products that we hadn't seen before on show and we 
hod to look hard to find some interesting new stuff. 
Years ago the Toy Fair was the place to visit in order 
to see oil the latest new releases, but sadly the advent 
of the internet means that most companies release

EXTREME FLIERS - www.extremef iers.co.uk 


The Micro Drone 3.0. has been developed by o whole new funding system 
called indiegogo (crowdfunding). So for they raised over $3 million on this 
project. 

The Micro Drone 3.0 combines expandable modular technology, sensor 
assisted flying and a micro gimbol for live streaming video. It is also the 
first fully custumisoble personal drone on the market with a host of features 
and functions. It is a drone suitable for everyone from video enthusiasts 
through to kids. 

The Micro Drone 3.0 uses a combination of intelligent motion sensors that 
allow it to hover and fly in perfect straight lines, and thus allows the focus 
to be more on filming and less on flying. Something that surprises was that 
this Micro Drone con fly in winds of up to 45mph thanks to its corrective 
algorithms. Normally with a small quodcoper of this size you will need to 
struggle while flying in the wind. 

Another cool feature is that you con choose how to fly it, either with your iOS, 
Android device or with a traditional transmitter. The opp to control is available 
for your smartphone and it has o special 3D mode for amazing first person 
view flying. On top of all this the Micro Drone con fly inverted with o flip 
of 0 switch or shake of the phone and the Micro Drone will fully invert 1 80 
degrees, reversing its propellers and flying upside down. 

No more cables with the Micro Drone, it has o modular snap on design which 
is 0 super fast way to connect and prevent any broken wire issue for the 
battery and camera. The conventional way to connect the camera to the drone 
is with 0 wire that plugs into the device. With Micro Drone 3.0 both power and 
connection is mode just by touching it together. It is also fully reversible so 
that you con capture forward facing and rear facing footage for that ultimate 
drone shot! The quick release battery con be swapped out in seconds thanks to 
the some snap on system.

FREAKWARE - AUGN - NEXT - www.freakware.de • www.beastx.de 



Freakware once again had all their innovations and new products on display at their booth during the Toy Fair. This year's 
highlight was the new Bluetooth module for the Microbeast, the latest version of the neXt simulator, the Align MR25 quads 
in a new outfit and of course the new Align T1 0 transmitter. Freakware focussed themselves this year more on Align 
with their new slogan 'We are Align'. Last year Robbe closed their doors which made Freakware exclusive distributors in 
Germany and Austria for the Align products. We did miss their own products like the Shape SB and the X-blades range on 
their booth. Let's see what highlights Freakware has to offer us. 

NEXT SIMULATOR 

At the Freakware stand we could find the latest update (1 .422) version of neXt - CGM RC Helicopter Simulator (www. 
rc-aerobatics.eu), which provides the following new features: Enhanced model selection of the Align MR25; new scenery 
including the X3D FPV Airrace FAI (according to the FAI rules built), advanced multi-copter physics; advanced camera 
gimbal functions (helicopter tab); stick position from which the control correction of the rescue system engages, can now be 
set; additional rescue mode for helicopters (normal with pitch); doubling the chat message storage; all heli setups can be 
exchanged via the chat window; lens reflection on the cameras. 

The new simulator combo consists of the neXt CGM RC Simulator-DVD, license key and RCWARE RX2SIM adapter for 
wireless simming is available for €1 1 9.90. 

RX2SIM 

We also discovered that the RX2SIM from 'RCWare' which includes a wireless multi-sim adapter with USB2SYS port 
now is included in a combo with the neXt simulator. With this little device, it is possible to move around with your own 
transmitter when using the flight simulator and all off this without having watch the wires. The multi-sim adapter supports 
single-channel, serial PPM for Phoenix, Realflight), Futaba S.Bus, SRXL, Spektrum satellite (DSM2/DSMX) and USB joystick 
modes (FMS, Heli-X). 

BEASTX 

Wireless configuration/programming of the Microbeast Plus HD. Freakware showed us the first prototype of a Bluetooth 
interface for the Microbeast-Plus HD Flybarless system. It's called BLE2SYS and is connected to the SYS port of the 
Microbeast. With latest version of the StudioX app, available for iOS, Android and OSX, you can change in real time very 
easy through the wireless interface all the parameters and settings of your Microbeast. 

ALIGN MR25 

Freakware was the first to show us the new outfits for the Align MR25 FPV racing quad. Apart from the standard canopy 
painted in yellow on the MR25 and green on the MR25P, they now are available in red-black-white and yellow-black-red 
designs. 

The UAV has a multi-function MRS flight controller with integrated ESC, PCU, OSD, Bluetooth 4.0 and gimbal control 
function; low air resistance by aerodynamic design; screwless locking of the canopy. The integrated Power Board ensures 
simple switching and displays the battery status; the LED is adjustable in 256 colours on the motors and the underside of 
the MR25 plus it includes LED turn signals and brake lights. 

Some other cool features are the powerful brushless motors; integrated HD-DV camera (720p @ 60fps or 
].080p@30fps); Realtime 5G8 video transmission with OSD (25 milliwatts, reach about 300 metres); Smartphone app 
(iOS / Android) for adjusting any setup parameter, to use the DV camera and the 'Lost Aircraft Finder' feature. 

It also has a stunt mode function for simple execution of rolls or flips. The motor mounts have a variable pitch (±30 
degrees) of all four motors and much more. 

ALIGN T10 TRANSMITTER 

For us as RC helicopter / FPV drone pilots one of the few 'real' innovations at this year's Toy Fair was that Wendy, owner 
of Align, presented me at the Freakware stand the brand-new T1 0 transmitter. It is a very ergonomic transmitter in a cool 
design with a very clear backlit LCD touch screen. The T-1 0 comes with 1 0-channels and is fully equipped with numerous 
switches and knobs that can be freely assigned via the easy-to-use software. With the introduction of racing quads Align 
now has introduced its own transmission protocoil called, 'Align FS i-bus' 2.4GHz protocol. It comes with a special support 
bracket for smartphones or FPV monitors. For the moment the T1 0 is only meant to use and come in combo with the Align 
MR25 racing quad however, the technique offers immense possibilities for the future, we are convinced that Align will 
release soon receivers so I can be used with regular helicopters. Price and availability of this will be announced shortly. 

ALIGN 7-INCH FPV LCD MONITOR 

With brands like Align that already have a racing quad like the Align MR25 in their programme, when it comes to first 
person view, flexibility is very important in terms of representation of the camera image. At the Freakware booth we 
saw the first prototype of the FPV monitor by Align. The display of the LCD monitor is 7 inches tall and has an internal 
built-in LiPo battery with a capacity of 4,000mAh for long periods of operation. The dual receiver in the 5.8GHz band used 
by default has antenna diversity and 32 channels. In order to transport the monitor comfortably, the three-part display 
antiglare is designed in a way it can fold. A flexible mounting bracket to attach it to your transmitter is included. The price 
on the Align website is $1 69.99. 

Some of the features of this LCD screen is that it utilises 7in TFT screen with LED backlight; automatic searching, simple and 
easy to operate; built in 32 channel dual receiver system featuring efficient reception and good stability that can receive 
two different channel separately; built in high capacity 4000mAh LiPo battery, featuring durability over 3 hours with full 
charge; 1 2V DC input/output, with power cable which supports external 3S battery charging. When run out of built in 
battery, it can connect to external power supply; multiple connectivity options can connect to transmitter or bracket easily; 
foldable sunshield featuring lightweight, easy to carry and not occupy space, even in bright light still can see clearly and 
supports AVIN/AV OUT. 

ALIGN AG-30 FPV GOGGLES 

Together with the Align MR25 Align now also released their corresponding FPV goggles. The goggles, called AG300 are 
extremely light, suitable for eyeglass wearers and has antenna diversity. There wasn't any detailed information available 
on the Freakware stad and they could not tell us the EU pricing, but the UK distributor has them available already with an 
RRP of £274.99.

The second highlight on the Horizon Hobby stand was the new Spektrum DX8 Gen 2. The DX8 comes with a 2000mAh Li-Ion battery, accessories such as 
charger, SD card and shoulder strap. The eight channel transmitter comes with the same proven AirWare software and features as found on the DX20 but with 
I a retail price of €299. 

I 

! BLADE 270 CFX 

One of my new favourites could be found at the Horizon Hobby stand, the new Blade 270 CFX uses 270mm main blades, a length of 67 mm and weighs 
I 626g. It comes equipped with the Spektrum Flybarless System (SPMAR721 OBX), which has a seven-channel DSMX receiver, combined with the BeastX 

I three-axis MEMS stabilisation in a single, super-lightweight block and SAFE technology with self-levelling Panic Recovery mode. In addition, the helicopter 

I has revised servo geometry and a powerful high-voltage drive. The extreme performance of the CFX 270 calls for a 6S LiPo battery. Additional features 

are a CNC-machined aluminium rotor head, carbon hull and reliable timing belt rear-wheel drive and digital Spektrum metal geared servos. To complete a 
I six-channel system and a 6S LiPo charger are required. 


BLADE ZEYROK 

The Blade Zeyrok quadcopter is the ideal drone for new pilots and anyone who wants a fun flying experience. Based on a proven power system, its next-gen 
airframe has been industrially engineered to have a futuristic concept appearance that's incredibly durable. But you'll have no trouble keeping it together, 
that's because the SAFE system of the Zeyrok drone is designed with multiple flight modes to provide the kind of confidence-building flying characteristics 
that makes lift-off as smooth as possible. As a result, you can develop from a beginner to expert drone pilot at the pace that's right for you. 

You can get the Zeyrok with a lightweight 720p/l .3MP camera, or add it later. The HD camera is built into a removable pod that features protective landing 
skids. Functionality of the video and still camera functions is controlled from your transmitter. A removable 4GB Micro SD memory card comes installed to 
get you started. 


BLADE VORTEX PRO 

■ This is a race-ready 250-class FPV quad for the experienced pilot. Blade and ImmersionRC have teamed up to deliver the cutting-edge Vortex 250 Pro multi- 
rotor with Spektrum technology. ImmersionRC introduced the original Vortex ARF when the FPV racing phenomena began. Now race seasoned experts across 

2 the globe have weighed in on how their power-packed little quad could be improved. Lighter, stronger and more powerful, the Blade Vortex 250 Pro is the 
next-level ImmersionRC 250-class racer with the benefits of Bind-N-Fly so you can FPV race like a pro, right out of the box.

SPEKTRUM AR72 1 0BX 

The AR721 OBX brings together the security of a DSMX receiver with a BeastX flybarless system in a single, lightweight unit. At the centre of its capabilities is a 
■■■■■■I high-resolution, six-axis MEMS stabilisation system that delivers flawless response in all types of conditions. You don't need a separate programming interface 
either. All setup and adjustment can be done with a DSM2 or DMSX transmitter. 


■■■■ ■ BLADE MACH 25 

IHII ■■ The Blade Mach 25 multi-rotor makes getting into 250-class quad-racing easy. The thick carbon-fibre plate construction with robust aluminium support makes 

2, assembled racer lightweight and incredibly durable. In the event of a mishap, replacement of the self-tightening propellers is all you'll likely need. 

Brilliant LED lighting helps with orientation and identification in the heat of a race. Powerful motors that are canted forward help give you the performance 
■■■■ ■! edge while the protected ultra micro FPV camera is soft mounted for the best view. The streamlined body combines improved aerodynamics with an additional 
2225 B! protection that makes your Mach 25 machine stand out from the pack. 


HUA JIA - www.rc-leading.com

Revell - m/wsevelLde 




m 




Once again, the Rotarwarld team (well, Neil the editar) made the lang jaurney over to Hall 
1 2.2 and Revell's permanent showroom at the Nuremberg Messe. Here the company had a 
full-size McLaren 650S sports cor on show in celebration of the company's release of a scale 
model of the car. They also had plenty of new RC model aircraft on display and it was no 
surprise that many took the form of drones. 

Revell is another manufacturer that has majored in the design and manufacturer of nano 
sized quadcopters and this year there were new iterations of the successful Nano Quod that 
won on award at the show in 2014. One of these new machines is called the Quodcopter 
Nano Quad Cam because, you guessed it, it has a camera fitted on the front. 

Another more serious entry into the quad market is the Revell Control Quodcopter 
Navigator. This stealthy looking machine is supplied with an impressive looking transmitter 
that has o built-in hi-res screen allowing the quod to be piloted using FPV (First Person 
View). 

Other new quods to come from Revell include the Formula Cam, Quadrotox and Quadrotox 
FPV, Funtic, Wi-Fi Quodcopter X-Spy 2.0 and powerful Formula Q to name just a few. 

But the most interesting new product that caught our eye on the Revell stand was a 
quodcopter advent calendar. Perfect for the drone enthusiast, this calendar provides a 
different part every day throughout the 24 days of December that are then built up into 
0 full functioning and flyoble quodcopter. It even includes o transmitter which is the part 
behind the big 24 December doors of the calendar. With an expected price point of around 
£30 to £40, we think this will be a big hit next Christmas so get your order in early.

■■ Silverlit - www.silverlit.com • www.flyingtoys.com 



As usual, well known manufacturer of tiny helicopters, Silverlit had a large stand over in 
Hall 6 of the Toy Fair, away from all the other RC manufacturers in Hall 7A. Their top heli 
designer, Alexander Van de Rostyne was hand to show us around and discuss their latest 
new products and innovations. 

As with many other RC model manufacturers, quodcopters or drones were the order of the 
day. Many of these new aircraft hove huilt-in cameras and sensors that moke them even 
safer to fly and also provide the possibility for First Person View (FPV) flight. 

Of particular interest to RC heli fans will be the new Hydrocopter. This new contra-rotating 
machine has a pair of foam float undercarriage skids that allows it to take off and land 
on water. 

The new Xcelsior quod features a good quality camera that con connect to a smartphone 
and provide FPV. The smartphone can either be mounted on the top of the transmitter, or 
housed inside some cardboard FPV goggles. When it's launched, the Xcelsior will provide 
one of the cheapest entries into FPV drone flight. 

Voyager Drone is another quadcopter from Silverlit. It uses a tried and tested design, 
but is packed with technology that will make it easy to fly and will be supplied complete 
with a transmitter. 

Following on from the success of the first Spy Drone quadcopter. Spy Drone 2 features 
an improved camera. This collection of small quads feature prop guards making them 
suitable for indoor flying in more confined spaces. 

The Blu-Tech Drone is yet another miniature marvel of technology from Silverlit. This 
compact little quad will connect to Apple iOS and Android smartphones, which ore then 
used to control them. Small enough to be considered pocket-sized, but just big enough to 
provide stable fight, the Blu-Tech drones ore o great quality product available at a very 
reasonable price. 

The Phoenix single rotor helicopter has on interesting design and looks o little different to 
other models in its doss. It's o pretty futuristic little chopper and is once again packed with 
technology that should help it to fly really well. 

Keeping up the Silverlit Picoo Z tradition, the Sky Griffin helicopter is the latest model to 
feature the tried and tested Picoo Z design philosophy originally pioneered by Alexander 
Von de Rostyne. It brings the micro helicopter bong up to dote with o futuristic and edgy 
looking body and the contra-rotating rotors will moke it easy for anyone to fly. 

For fans of the Chinook twin rotor helicopter, Silverlit hove come up with o micro-sized 
version called the Nano Tandem. Once again featuring o pair of contra-rotating rotor- 
heads, this little beauty is charged direct from its transmitter. This model is very easy 
to fly and incredibly stable in the air so it's sure to appeal to newcomers and seasoned 
pilots alike. 

Silverlit already holds the official Guinness World Record for the smallest RC helicopter, the 
Nano Falcon, but now there is ore two new versions, the Nano Falcon AH and XS. Both ore 
absolutely tiny contra-rotating helicopters that fly really well in any indoor environment. 
Both ore charged from their transmitters, which makes them o very compact and easy to 
carry package that's ready for o fly whenever and wherever you ore. 

Something o little different to flying models is the Silverlit SpyCom Aqua. This is actually 
0 small yellow submarine with o front mounted underwater camera that could be used 
for fun in the both or aquarium. In fact it even comes with o front scoop that can be filled 
with fish food in order to encourage your pet fish to come up to the camera. This is yet 
another example of the sort of innovation the Silverlit R&amp;D team have been coming up 
with for many years now and is sure to prove o hit when it's released in the summer.

TRAXXAS - traxxas.com • www.logicrc.com 




ATOM Plus 

This new Traxxas Aton range brings a new all-in-one concept in the world of multi-rotors by having o sporty design and offering the features of on aerial platform. The Aton quodcopter is the 
second model from Traxxas, o manufacturer that has previously focussed on mainly RC surface vehicles. 

The Plus edition of the Aton quodcopter comes additionally with a 2-oxis brushless gimbol which is o must hove for aerial filming. In order to compensate the extra weight of the gimbol and 
camera the Traxxas Aton Plus is powered with o higher capacity battery than the basic version. The SOOOmAh battery allows to the fully equipped Aton Plus about 20-25 minutes of flight 
autonomy. The price difference between the two models is around €1 05. 

On the rear port of the aircraft there is o nice status bar with four bright LEDs that highlight each of the functions using pictogroms - very simple but neat! As previously mentioned, 

the Traxxas Aton quodcopter has o nice sporty design. When used os racing quodcopter the landing legs con be removed to achieve even more aerodynamic form. Being optimised for oil kind 

of pilots (photographer, fun flyer or skilled trick master) the Traxxas Aton has three working modes of "Film", "Sport" and "Expert". 

Under the canopy of the aircraft there is o Micro SD memory cord slot which is used to upgrade the firmware of the flight controller. This way you don't need to connect the quodcopter to your 
computer and install drivers and other tools. &gt;

WIN6SLAND - www.szsungreen.com/en 


The Chinese manufacturer Wingsland is based in Shenzhen and have already had ane multi-ratar available 
an the market, the Minivet. They toak advantage af the Tay Fair 201 6 ta unveil two new models, and also 
teamed up with Gens Ace to include their batteries in their Wingsland drones. 

WINGSLAND K3 

The K3 is made with a mix of aluminium alloy and carbon fibre, which allows the body to be durable, safe 
and strong. It has various functions and supports many features. It is equipped with a three-axis high- 
precision gimbal and uses a 4K camera to record videos in Ultra HD resolution and take amazing stills. 

In order to have a great stability during take off and landing, the Wingsland K3 quadcopter is equipped 
with three landing skids. The rear one is actually formed by two shock absorbers like used in cars. 

It supports numerous control modes and the drone's remote controller even has built-in GPS so it can 'follow 
you' around, along with many other functions. There will also be an obstacle avoidance module available 
for the drone ta some point after its release. 

Combined with a system that has been enhanced for complete safety, the efficient battery of the drone 
provides a great flight time and easy controls. 

The 4K UHD camera is installed through a three-axis brushless gimbal. The "tilt" angle of the camera as 
well as the "pan" angle can be remotely controlled. 

It seems a great idea adding GPS to the remote controller, this way the "follow me" mode con be used 
without any additional device (like smartphone for example). 

WINGSLAND MS 

This is the latest quadcopter drone to be released by Wingsland the MS FPV. Unlike many of the other 
camera drones coming to market the MS does not hove an attached gimbal. 

Wingsland state that they have patented the quick assembly/disassembly system for the MS. The body has 
been designed to incorporate an anti-vibration, shock absorption system to ensure smooth stable flight. 

The Wingsland MS FPV camera drone boasts some impressive features - return to home, a follow me 
function, dual satellite positioning system, low battery voltage alarm, point of interest and a headless mode 
flying feature. 

On paper the MS looks o very interesting FPV Camera Drone, but it will need to be glitch free and deliver 
excellent video footage to complete with the likes of DJI and Intel-funded Yuneec. To celebrate their 1 0 
year anniversary DJI dropped the prices of their outstanding P3 range, you can now buy the Phantom 3 
Standard for under €S00. Yuneec have done similar with their Yuneec Typhoon G model available at a 
similar price to the P3 Standard. 

It has a 4K camera so capture could be excellent. It is possible to get jello free video from camera drones 
that do not support gimbals and the MS looks well designed to achieve that aim. 

The body shape is DJI Inspire-like and the orange and black combination of colours looks great. 

Today in this entry-level aerial photography space it's not just how the model performs but also the 
support offered by the manufacturers. On-line tutorials, a great app, spare part availability and customer 
communication skills are all necessary if you are to become a successful player. The MS will give Wingsland 
the opportunity to prove their capabilities.

While Xiro is a new brand in consumer smart drone space, the core 
technology is rooted in the leading professional UAV developer Zero 
Tech. The founders of Xiro ore engineers themselves who would go 
through every detail of each design to moke sure their products were 
stunning in appearance with superior technologies. Equipped with one 
of the leading flight control units, multi-axis stabilised gimbol, high 
quality picture transmission, Follow-Me Selfie and Follow Snap image 
recognition technology, Xiro is surely bringing the whole UAV drone 
industry to another new level. 

XPLORER 2 

The Xplorer 2 has been totally revamped on oil technical specifications, 
almost oil individual modules hove gone for o major upgrade; 4K 
recording, 720P/ 1km image transmission, high-copocity Lithium 
battery, moke it one of the most powerful consumer-grade UVAs.The 
most amazing function of Xplorer 2 will be the auto obstacle avoidance 
technology, which uses infrared for real-time detection of any obstacle 
around. Users will be alerted if the drone is closing to obstacles and con 
actively ovoid the collision before the user con moke any adjustments. 
This is the first time such advance system being deployed in consumer 
UAV market. 

It is probably the world's first working prototype of o drone to feature 
obstacle avoidance in the 350-size category. 

XPLORER MINI 

The Xplorer Mini looks more like o finished product than the Xtreme. 
The smaller Xplorer Mini is aimed squarely at the lifestyle market and 
will probably appeal to foshionistos with its interchangeable fuselage 
covers that feature funky graphics and colours - probably another 
industry first for commercially available drones. 

Weighing just 450g and with o footprint no larger than an iPod, the 
Xplorer Mini was designed primarily os o portable lifestyle and travel 
photography drone. Its motor arms con be folded and tucked in without 
the need to remove the propellers, making it highly portable when you 
need to travel. No bogs or cases ore needed when transporting it. Just 
drop it into your backpack or sling bog and you're ready to go. 

The Xplorer Mini's small form factor con be o bit deceiving, giving you 
the impression that it is just another toy quodcopter, but don't let that 
small exterior fool you. The Mini is packed with some high-end features 
commonly found in bigger and more expensive aerial photography 
drones. The list includes duol-GPS (GLONASS -i- GPS), optical flow 
sensors, brushless motors, a 1 300mAh intelligent flight battery and a 
13MP HD camera. 

The availability of duol-GPS also means that the Mini is capable of 
intelligent flight modes such os Follow Me and 360 Selfies (hover 
around point). 

To keep things simple, Xiro bos decided not to include o conventional 
transmitter with the Xplorer Mini. Instead, the drone uses o smartphone 
opp os its primary control device. Assuming the opp uses Wi-Fi to 
communicate with the drone, this is both good and bod. Having o 
smartphone opp to manually pilot o drone may result in some serious 
control issues. If o smartphone uses Wi-Fi to communicate with the Mini, 
it may take some time for the Mini to respond to pilot input which will 
result in sluggish pilot control. 

The 2.4GHz frequency used by Wi-Fi could also potentially interfere 
with GPS reception. 

With that said, we believe most pilots would probably ovoid manually 
flying the Xplorer Mini unless it is absolutely necessary. After oil, the 
Mini wasn't designed for precision drone racing so we don't expect 
anyone to fly it fast around tight spaces. Future Mini owners will 
probably feel more comfortable using the opp to do automated stuff 
such os automatic landing and take off, instead of manually flying it. 

XPLORER XTREME 

On the other end of the spectrum in the latest Xiro line-up is the aptly 
named Xplorer Xtreme. Designed primarily for professional aerial 
photography, the Xtreme features retractable motor arms that also 
double os landing legs. It is pretty much inspired by the DJI Inspire 1 
and was probably designed to compete directly with the DJI flagship. 
The Xtreme carries a three-axis gimbol-stobilized 4K micro 4/3 camera 
with 0 720P HD video downlink that con reach o distance of 2km. Not 
much detail is available yet on the Xtreme and there is no official word 
on when it will be available for orders. 


















YUNEEC - http://yuneec.uk

TYPHOON H 

DJI-rivol Yuneec bos o new hexocopter under its Typhoon line 
of drones - the Typhoon H - and it is compatible with o collision 
avoidance module hosed on Intel's ReolSense technology. 

This is 0 serious contender to DJI's line-up. The Yuneec Typhoon 
H comes equipped with a 360-degree gimbol camera that con take 
4K videos and 1 2-megopixel stills, and its rotor arms ore mode of 
lightweight carbon fibre. The new Typhoon H also has o full suite 
of autonomous features, such os Orbit, Point of Interest, Curved 
Coble, and something called Journey. It has basic sense and ovoid 
technology on board, using "ultrasonic proximity detection" to 
automatically dodge large obstacles. The Typhoon H, like the Inspire 
1, has retractable landing gear and a camera which con pan o full 
360 degrees. 

The Intel collision avoidance add-on, which will be available at 
on extra cost, could be worth the money to moke sure the drone 
doesn't crash into other objects. It allows the drone to sense and 
ovoid objects in real time. 

The Typhoon H, like the Inspire 1, bos retractable landing gear and 
0 camera which con pan o full 360 degrees. Unlike the Inspire and 
the previous version of the Typhoon, the new unit has six rotors 
instead of four. Yuneec soys this will allow the croft to remain stable 
and land in the event it loses one or two motors. 

Yuneec's biggest advantage here might be price and the ability to 
sense and ovoid. A fully equipped Typhoon H currently costs $1,799 
and is roughly $800 less than o new Inspire 1 . "A central port of our 
mission is to bring new and advanced creative possibilities within the 
reach of everyone," said Yu Tion, chief executive officer of Yuneec 
International. "We've engineered the Typhoon H to redefine what 
customers should expect to pay for o drone with such on array of 
professional features. At this price point, no other drone comes close 
to the Typhoon H in terms capability and value." 

The second half of this value proposition, the ability to see obstacles 
and prevent crashes, is something we're looking forward to testing 
once we get our hands on a review unit. In addition to its ultrasonic 
proximity sensor, Yuneec said the Typhoon H was built to allow for 
additional components, such os Intel's ReolSense camera, to expand 
its capabilities in the future. If this tech works well, that would be o 
very compelling reason for any pilot, beginner or professional, to 
pick this drone over the current competition, none of which offer 
anything like robust sense and ovoid. 

YUNEEC TORNADO H920 

The Tornado H920 is o professional multi-rotor aerial photography 
and videogrophy platform. It has o unique modular design and 
innovative features that moke it possible to capture impressive 
photographs and video footage. It is compatible with two camera 
options - the standard Panasonic GH4 and Yuneec's CG04 gimbol 
camera. 

The ST24 on 24-chonnel 2.4GHz RC transmitter - it's o personal 
ground station that includes built-in hardware and functionality for 
0 5.8GHz video downlink, 7-inch touch screen display and built-in 
Android powered tablet. With the portable ST24, it's no longer 
necessary to use separate components to view real-time video and 
telemetry data during flight. 

The GB603 is o three-axis, brushless motor driven and self- 
stabilising professional camera gimbol. Its lightweight yet rigid 
aluminium frame is capable of carrying the Panasonic GH4 to 
capture amazing photographs and video footage for o variety 
of uses. 

Included is the Prooction, o ground handle that is designed to 
extend remarkably smooth footage from the sky to the ground. The 
dual grip handle is compatible with the GB603 and CG04 camera 
gimbals, allowing you to capture ultra-stable footage even in the 
most turbulent circumstances. ^

ON TEST - Hubsan H50IS X4 FPV 


C onfession time, I hod always thought that 

Hubsan were squarely pitched selling quads 
at the toy end of the market; big mistake. In 
December last year visiting the Drone Show in 
Birmingham, my hit list of stands didn't include Hubsan, 
but on passing them I noticed some new larger models 
on offer. Drawn like a moth to a flame I was checking 
them out before I knew it. They are designated the X4 
series and currently offered in two variants, the X4 PRO 
and the X4 FPV H501 S. Basically the X4 PRO has the 
camera on a gimbal, a sophisticated Transmitter (Tx) 
and pitched at the prosumer, the H501S has a fixed 
1080P HD camera and a simpler Tx, perfect for the 
beginner to quads or FPV (First Person View). Okay, 
review done. Well, that's what I would be saying if I 
hadn't been so impressed with mine. 


HUBSAN SAY! 

So what do you get for your money then? The UK 
version of the H501 S is sold as RTF. Eye catching in 
Black and Gold, also available in White and Gold, 
it has an impressive specification; read that as lots 
of included features. CML are the distributor for the 
H501 S in the UK and I thought it would be interesting 
to see if the advertising blurb matched my experiences. 

Hubsan say: "Having a built-in GPS, Altitude Hold, 
Head Free Mode, Return to Home and Follow Me, 
makes the quad easier to fly. The built-in GPS enables 
the quadcopter to enter into failsafe mode if the 
connection to the radio transmitter is lost. In failsafe 
mode the flight control system will automatically control 
the quadcopter and return to the home-point and land 
safely; you can also manually switch the Quad to 
failsafe mode directly from the return to home function 


switch on the transmitter. The built-in GPS is also utilized 
for the Follow me mode which enables the quad to 
follow and record your activities. The multi-function 
transmitter features a built-in 4.3" FPV LCD screen 
displaying clear 5.8 GHz real-time video transmission 
from the Quads on-board 1080P HD camera. It has 
conveniently placed switches and buttons on the front 
face of the transmitter for GPS, RTH and camera/ 
video functions make this quad a pleasure to use. With 
a stylish and sleek body shape, LED lighting that also 
indicates various operational states, the H501S is the 
ideal entry to a more rewarding FPV and Aerial camera 
footage experience. The 1 080P HD camera allows 
for some stunning aerial photography and videos and 
the high capacity battery coupled with the carefully 
optimised power system can give flight times of 20-25 
minuets". Let's really find out what it's like. 


Flying High 

OUR RESIDENT QUADCOPTER EXPERT SHAUN GARRITXTESTS OUT HUBSAN'S 
ENTRY INTO THE COMPETITIVE PROSUMER EPV DRONE MARKET 





WHAT'S IN THE BOX? 

The external packaging box is made from good 
quality cardboard; so what you may be thinking, but it 
provides ample protection for storing and transporting 
your new toy without the expense of buying anything 
else. Inside oil the bits ore stored in on injection 
moulded plastic insert. Besides the Quod, and Tx 
you also get two sets of self tightening props, prop 
wrench, o 2700mAh 2S LiPo, balance charger, UK 
power supply and the manual. As always hove o good 
read of this first. It is been thoughtfully written to help 
o complete beginner but adequately explains oil the 
features for o seasoned pilot without dumbing it down. 

As this is ready to fly oil you need to do is put four 
AA batteries in the Tx, screw on the props and other 
than charging the LiPo you ore ready to go. The Tx 
has been purpose designed for FPV use having the 


minimum of switches to perform oil the necessary tasks 
and the Video screen sensibly placed at the top. All 
the calibration and programming of it and the quod is 
done via stick and switch gestures; the screen provides 
on easy visual display of what's going on. There ore 
two well placed switches (that con be operated without 
removing your thumbs from the sticks) for GPS / Height 
Hold and Return to Home and by pressing the sticks 
down briefly you con activate Headless and Follow 
Me modes. The only other buttons ore for operating the 
camera functions, one for single shots and the other for 
video on and off. You hove two options for recording 
the Video; there is o TF Cord socket on the side of the 
Tx in addition to the one on the Quod (which is the 
preferred way to get the best quality image), o socket to 
plug the optional video goggles into and o USB socket 
for software upgrades.

The connector 


used is an EC2 


Self-tightening propellers make life easy and as they 
have handed threads, unless you force them on it's 
virtually impossible to get them reversed. Also they are 
marked A or B with matching letters on the motor arms. 
You really would have to be one card short of a deck 
to get this wrong. The prop wrench is used to lock the 
motors when you need to remove them. 

The charger simply connects to the balance plug and 
is fully automatic in operation. It charges at less than 
1C, taking approximately 150 minutes to complete but 
this is a very safe rate and should give the maximum 
charge cycles. As always never charge the LiPo in the 
model. I use an old oven proof glass dish to put them 
in and well away from combustible objects just in case. 
Hats off to Hubsan as they have included a separate 
leaflet covering LiPo care, storage, and where not to fly 
your H501 S. 

The LiPo is a tight fit in the battery bay so a little care 
is needed when fitting and removing it, possibly adding 
some tape tabs would help get it out a little easier. 

The LiPo is provided with an EC2 connector and you 
need to neatly arrange the wires so the battery hatch 
will close. From what I've read, I believe the LiPo has 
inbuilt, overcharge protection, (but 1 may be wrong), 
so it would be inadvisable to use it on a regular LiPo 
charger; stick with the supplied one. I have some 2S - 
2200mAh LiPos that are only 1 year old that fit: it just 
shows how LiPo capacity has developed because as 
mentioned, the supplied one is 2700mAh and the same 
dimensions. 

One important thing to do is calibrate your new 
transmitter. Well documented, don't forget to do this 
or you could have problems arming your H501 S. 

There really is no reason to go into the programming 
menus at this stage unless you are flying with other FPV 
equipped models and you need to change the video 
Tx/Rx frequency to avoid conflicts. 


PLAYTIME 

Power it up and go fly but one thing you need to do on 
the current software release is calibrate the compass 
each time. Actually this is no bad thing and it only 
takes a minute. Refer to the manual as the procedure is 
also well documented. Very importantly make sure you 
have at least six satellites acquired otherwise the GPS / 
RTH function wont work. At the flying field, there were 
no dramas and it fairly quickly acquired 1 1 satellites 
for the H501 S and the Tx GPS had 6 showing (the 
minimum needed for Follow Me to work). 

With GPS and RTH turned off adding some throttle, it 
smoothly climbed and settled into the hover. I needed to 
trim it a little but then it just sat there, (obviously moving 
around slightly as it wasn't locked in place by the GPS). 

I was surprised with the clarity of the video image 
considering I was outside and didn't have a sunshade 
on the screen. The telemetry was working fine showing 
the battery capacity from the quad, altitude, speed, 
distance, recording time and what current flight mode it 
was in, in my case 'Altitude'. 

To get the feel of it, I flew around in Line of Sight 
(LoS) and it is clear that the product has been well 
developed and the flight controller appropriately tuned. 
As supplied you fly the H501 S with the throttle at centre 
stick position, (just like the DJI Phantom) and in altitude 
mode. I found the control response a little numb, but 
as my normal steeds are 250 FPV racers or larger full 
3D quads this isn't at all surprising. I let a friend who 
has very little experience have a go and he had no

On wrestling it back from him after he flew out the rest 
of the LiPo I went into the menu and upped the control

TESTING THE MODES 

I was keen to try out some of the other features 
especially Follow Me os this would be o first. I bunged 
another LiPo in the H501S and making sure I hod 
the requisite minimum six satellites on the Tx, I went 
skyward again into o hover. Briefly pressing the throttle 
stick activated it and glancing at the screen confirmed 
it was on. It's a little surreal having on aerial stalker 
following you but it works great and is a little addictive. 

Head Free mode works well os long as you correctly 
calibrated the compass. If you're not familiar with this 
mode it basically allows the model to follow the Tx stick 
movement irrespective of the orientation of the quod. It's 
useful for LOS when learning but flying FPV could prove 
very confusing. 

Switching on GPS holds your H501S pretty much 
stationary and confirmation of this is shown on the 
screen. Time to see how RTH works, you need to hove 


Under each motor is o 
translucent landing leg that houses 
o multi coloured LED which 
indicates orientation and various 
states such os low battery, GPS 
mode, RTH etc. 

It's worth learning them os they 
provide o quick visual reference as 
to what's going on. 

FIRST PERSON VIEW 

The video/FPV capabilities ore what 
moke this quad really interesting. 
Whilst the 1 080P HD camera isn't 
gimbol mounted, it produces good 
results. Not wanting to take mine 
opart I spoke with CML, the UK 
distributor, and discovered that the 



On the H50IS the memory 
card slot is conveniently 
located on the side 




FINAL THOUGHTS 

Until I flew the H501S, I hod 
always used goggles for FPV not 

0 screen, but although it was o 
less immersive experience it was 
still fun. I'm sure many people will 
actually prefer this way. Overall 

it performs exactly os advertised 
with no surprises and one feature 

1 particularly like is Hubson hove 
responsibly programmed the UK 
model to limit the height it will 
fly at and optimised for UK GPS 
use. Unfortunately some owners 
hove decided to try to change the 
software to the version shipped 

in Chino (os they ore apparently 
supplied with no height limit and 



o minimum of 6 satellites and remember it returns to 


camera is fixed in o foam surround 


The I080P forward facing 


you don't need to calibrate the 




the take off point as the crow flies, there is no obstacle 
avoidance so if o tree for example is in its flight path 
the tree will win, the H501S will loose. Also it will 
return bock to where it was powered up so please don't 
do this at your cor and walk out with it to the take off 
point. Oh by the way, it works well and come back 
pretty close to its take off location when tested. 

One mode I didn't try was 'Manual' mode; you need 
to go into the Tx menu to select this option. It basically 
deactivates altitude mode allowing you to flip, loop 
and roll (but you can't hove GPS or RTH switched in). 
Although every bone in my body wanted to have some 
aerobatic fun, if I planted it finishing the review on time 
would hove proved difficult. However I hove seen You 
tube videos of it been thrown around, so I'm confident it 
con deliver the goods. The other mode I didn't try was 
failsafe os I'm not inclined to switch off my Tx when 
flying o model that's perfectly under control.

As the camera also provides the 
live feed for the Tx screen you ore 
shooting exactly what you see and very little latency 
is evident. Should you need to, you con change the 
transmitting / receiving frequency of the video easily in

goggles and there were no problems. In operation 
one slight issue with the Tx is the batteries deplete 
much quicker than on o standard Tx as you don't hove 
the option of turning off the video screen and video

THE DRONE POPULARITY EXPLOSION ALONG 
WITH TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS HAS LED 
TO AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF FIRST PERSON 
VIEW (FPV) PILOTING. IT TAKES A CERTAIN LEVEL 
OF SKILLTO FLY AN AIRCRAFT USING FPV AND 
THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES AND LAWS THAT HAVE 
TO BEADHEREDTO. BUT STICKTOTHE RULES AND 
MASTERTHE FLYING ANDTHERE IS A LOT OF FUN 
TO BE HAD INCLUDING SOME CLOSE RACING 


Piiat^s eue t/iew 


F PV flight involves mounting a small video 

camera and transmitter on an RC aircraft and 
flying by means of a live video down-link, 
commonly displayed on video goggles worn 
by the pilot, or LCD transmitter screen or even a 
smartphone. Pilots have been experimenting with this 
type of control for a few years, but it is only relatively 
recently that the technology has evolved to the point 
where it is a viable way of operating an RC aircraft. 
Manufacturers have been quick to pick up on this 
option of flying as if you are inside the cockpit of the 
aircraft and have started to produce models with built-in 
cameras and the necessary hardware to enable live 
video broadcast back to the controller. 

When flying FPV, the pilot sees from the aircraft's 
perspective, and does not even have to look at the 
model. UK legal video transmitters operate at a 
frequency of 2.4GfHz and 5.8GFIz at a power level of 
lOmW and 25mW respectively. 


BACK TO BASICS 

A basic FPV system consists of a camera, video 
transmitter, video receiver, and a display. More 
advanced setups commonly add in specialised 
hardware, including on-screen displays with GPS 
navigation and flight data, stabilisation systems, and 
autopilot devices with 'return to home' capability — 
allowing the aircraft to fly back to its starting point on 
its own in the event of signal loss. 

On-board cameras can be equipped with a pan and 
tilt mount, which when coupled with video goggles and 
'head tracking' devices creates a truly immersive, first- 
person experience, as if the pilot was actually sitting in 
the cockpit of the RC aircraft. 

Flelicopters, multi-rotors and fixed-wing RC aircraft 
are used for FPV flight. 'Flying wing' designs are also 
popular for FPV, as they provide the best combination 
of large wing surface area, speed, manoeuvrability, 
and gliding ability. FPV aircraft are frequently used for 
aerial photography and videography. 



FPV racers can sit down as they pilot their air- 
craft as if they are actually sitting in the cockpit 
which can seem a bit odd at first 




FPV AND THE LAW 

Until recently, operation of model aircraft out of the line 
of sight of either the pilot in charge, or the competent 
observer, where applicable, was unlawful. 

Air Navigation Order (UK Air Law) Article 1 66 
(3) states: "The person in charge of a small unmanned 
aircraft (SUA) must maintain direct, unaided visual 
contact with the aircraft sufficient to monitor its flight path 
in relation to other aircraft, persons, vehicles, vessels and 
structures for the purpose of avoiding collisions." 

The implication for FPV RC was that the pilot wearing 
the video goggles cannot, by definition, be the pilot in 
charge of the model and that there must be a separate 
'pilot in charge' at all times. However since 30th 
September 2012, after negotiations between the CAA 
(Civil Aviation Authority), BMFA (British Model Flying 
Association) and other associations the CAA effectively 
relaxed the requirement for the use of a buddy lead 
when flying a model aircraft using 'First Person View' 
techniques by the issuing of an exemption to ANO 
Article 166(3). This only applies for fixed wing aircraft 
of less than 3.5kg and rotorcraft of less than 3.5kg 
and there are certain other conditions which must be 
complied with. 

FPV pilots should also ensure that all equipment they 
use is legal for use in the UK, especially in relation to 
the operating frequency and power output. 

FPV RACING 

If you're into drones and FPV, you've almost certainly 
seen the online viral video of the French Airgonay team, 
featuring pilots zooming through the forest Star Wars 
Speeder Bike style, in a scene reminiscent of Return 
of the Jedi. If not you can watch it on YouTube via the 
following link: https://youtu.be/ZwL0t5kPf6E 

FPV racing is still in its infancy, but it's rapidly 
gathering momentum across the world as people 
discover the thrill of being able to zoom around with 
their mates, defying gravity in a 3D space. 



Racing courses now vary with some using obstacles that need to be negotiated as part of the race 



The first FPV racing courses were set up in forests using the trees as natural obstacles 
leading to the comparison with the Star Wars Speeder Bike chase

The sight of FPV pilots standing still while racing their aircraft using 
goggles is set to become more common at flying events 


The biggest development that has 
driven the FPV racing scene has been 
the development of smaller, 'mini' 250 
size quads. Before these became widely 
available, most FPVers were flying larger 
450 sized quads and hexes. Larger quads 
are great for cruising, but lack the agility 
and - more importantly - durability of the 
minis. It's simply a question of mass; less 
mass means you can crash into all sorts 
of things, and most of the time all you 
break are props. The ability to crash and 
continue after minor repairs has enormous 
appeal to anyone on a limited budget. It 
also lets you push your boundaries, and 
when you do that, you improve as a pilot 
very quickly indeed. 

Mini quads are cheaper to run as well 
- the batteries are smaller and therefore 


cheaper. They also require a lot less space 
to have fun. You can head to your local 
park, find a few clusters of trees, and set up 
your own practice course in a few minutes. 

Manufacturers are gradually catching up 
with the home brew builders and offering 
commercially available kits or off the shelf 
RTF products (see Buyer's Guide panel). 

There are also now FPV racing events 
being organised and a new a group of 
FPV pilots have come together to form 
the British FPV Racing League. With 
the support of the British Model Flying 
Association, the British FPV Racing League 
has one clear mission: to promote and 
protect the sport of FPV racing and ensure 
it remains accessible to all by bringing 
together all the Independent groups and 
giving them one voice. ■

AHEAD 


MARKET-LEADING RC HELI MANUEACTURER, ALIGN IS NOW READYTO HITTHE BURGEONING 250 SIZE QUAD RAGING 
SECTOR WITH ITS LATEST PRODUCTTHE AEROBATIC MR25 WHICH IS READYTO ELY STRAIGHT OUT OETHE BOX. SO 
THE QUESTION IS, CAN THE COMPANYTAKE ONTHE QUAD RACING SCENE AND WIN JUST LIKETHEY HAVE WITH RC 

HELICOPTERS? JAMIE COLETRIESTO EINDTHE ANSWER 


O ver 10 years ago Align launched its 
opening play into the RC heli market 
and quickly established itself as a 
credible player. Within a couple 
of years they had a full range of 
machines, more importantly they came to the table 
with an out of the box solution that just worked. They 
took away oil of the 'black arts' of how to set up 


machines. The most significant fact of oil is that they 
transformed the cost of modelling and made it totally 
accessible, not so much of a problem with our quods, 
but o ready to fly FPV racer needs o lot of research 
and there ore plenty of block arts in configuration, set 
up and god forbid you if can't work o soldering iron! 

You con also cost your mind bock to early 2015 
when Align launched a very capable range of high 


end quods aimed at the 'prosumer' and professional 
level aerial photography users. Like the RC helis they 
hove launched o product that is accessible and of 
high quality, no one con deny they ore on awesome 
package which ore great value for money. 

So here we ore in 2016 and what hove Align 
set their sights on? Well it is the 250 quod racing 
market. This 250 racing is on interesting one and

something that is arguably a steep learning curve of set 
up, soldering, PIDs gains, props, lights etc , you could 
say it is a bit of a black art! If you want to get started 
you need to know your 2204s from your onions and 
your PIDs from your P. Diddy! There is so much to learn 
and to get your head around, so many frames, flight 
controllers, props and god knows what else to think 
about, so many variables. This is where Align can make 
a difference and this is what the MR25 is aimed at. 

Take away all of that pain, take it out of the box, plug a 
battery in and charge. So we got hold of the MR25 to 
see if it is up to the job. 

TARGET MARKET? 

There will be those that know their stuff on 250 racing 
quads, who will have the fastest and maddest machines 
out there. They would have spent a long time getting 
to that stage, I doff my hat to you. But this MR25 will 
impress you as it ticks a lot of the boxes. 

If you have never tried a 250 racing quad this 
could be a great option. If you want to give it a go 
but don't want to spend days soldering, programming 
or fannying around then this is for you. If you have 
experience of flying 250 quads than this is still right up 
your street. 

There are two ways to fly 250 racers: one is 
remotely, which is fun and as much fun as flying RC 


helis; the other is through FPV (first person view) goggles 
and that is good fun! This is where FPV racing comes 
alive and this is why it has taken off so much and 
so quickly. 

BUILDING 

If you like tea then you can put the kettle on, although 
by the time you have finished making the tea the model 
will be built and ready for set up! You need to install 
your chosen receiver and most of the main 2.4GHz 
remote antennas are supported and more are coming. 
You have DSM2, DMSS, Futaba S.BUS, JR X.BUS, a 
new up and coming Align variant and conventional 
receiver types, i.e. use your own separate receiver type 
of your choice. 

You can slot in a remote antenna and then plug an 
adaptor lead into the main board, this adaptor lead 
reduces the voltage to 3.3V which is needed for remote 
antenna and also converts from a conventional servo 
type plug to that of the antennas. 

If you opt for a separate receiver make sure it's a 
slim-line one to fit it neatly between the lower and upper 
deck of the frames. You may also need to get your 2mm 
hex tool out in order to remove the upper deck to wire 
in your receiver. 

The battery is stuck to the upper deck with Velcro 
under the outer shell. At this stage you could actually

a death wish or like to juggle knives but at this stage 
you need to set up the transmitter and then install your 

Assuming you hove set up the model you con install 
the props. It's pretty simple and quick to 
clockwise and two clockwise, all clearly labelled with 
numpty proof arrows of direction, the prop nuts ore 
such that they self tighten. 


]Ito!!th?s the**order of the day! First thing you will 
:ed to do is get yourself on the Google l|ay 
Apple App store and search for Align MRS , then 

)wnload the app. a ado / 

Once downloaded you can turn on your MRio/ 
iR25P, open the app, select the ^RS fr°m the 
/ailable devices and away you go. VVe tried the 
ndroid and the Apple iOS versions of the software 

hich both worked a treat. 

The app is super simple to use and allows set up ot 
le transmitter, model and camera settings. 


le setup menus are; . . ^ , 

Transmitter type - to select the transmission type, i.( 

SMorFutaba. , 

Transmitter settings - match your transmitter and 
iverses to these settings. 


1 Parameter settings - this gives you all of the model 
erformance settings. r • ^ 

I Camera setting - to change the settings of image 

I^MRS settings - to change controls of things like the 
limbal control, tilt of the camera 
» MRS Settings page 2 - Low voltage settings and au o 

» LED settings - you can change all the LED colours 
» Final set up pages - Reference information for set up 
3 nd lights etc. 

In matching the transmitter up you need to select the 
channel allocation correctly and line up the sub-trims 
and adjust the travel to fill up the bars on the screen. If 
you have set up a V-Bar or a GPro flybarless system on 
a heli you will know exactly what 1 mean. If you haven t 
it means messing around with trims and travel to get 
the perfect match. On my DXl 8 it just required some 
extension of the travel and the allocation of the motor 

The motors are turned on by a switch and are then 
always running until this channel / switch is triggered 
again, throttle, that's the gear switch and the auxiliary 
switch allows control of the flight modes. You will need 
a three position switch for this to activate the flight 
modes (channel 6) which are; , . , r i 

Attitude mode - self-levelling mode, hold the stick 
forwards and it will go to a maximum angle then return 
to centre when you back - super easy to fly. 

Normal - flies like an RC heli and is capable of steep 
anales as well as loops and rolls. 


Sport - this is double hardcore out the box, super 
agile and on it, perfect for racing. 

One"^otihe*hings about these quads, especially in the 
early days is there is always room for 'mpi-ovement 
in the soLare and Align have catered for this with 
the ability to update your MR25 through the use of 
a bluetooth connection from a PC or Mac. Since we 
had an early release we needed to use , 

occasions and we can report it worked rea ly welk The 
apps are on the Play store and the Apple store pretty 
quickly and these normally need to be used to unlock 

the new features of the software updates. 

Already a few weeks since the launch. Align have 
made some user-friendly tweaks such as adding 
functionality for use with eight channel radio sets rather 
than the previous need for nine if you wanted to initiate 
camera recording in the air. Super simple and ,t works 
really well. There is now a 4s option where you can 
chanV the cut off voltage although jT ' 

only take up to the 5 x 4.5 props, any higher and the 
motors and speedos will get a hard time pull too much. 
But there are some new 2205 motors and mounts 
available for those that one that insane performance.

IMPRESSIONS , , , 

First impressions with the MR25 sat on the desk are 
that it is probably one of the most aesthetically pleasing 
machines out there. I'm not gomg to ca 1 1 pre^

out there. To me they mostly feel and look like an 
unfinished model helicopters in very early beta 
testing, unfinished if you like. This is by far the best 
of the bunch and looks like a finished model thanks 
to the outer shell which is a tough plastic. Don't be 
fooled into thinking it's all looks and no function, it 
is protective and does a good job as we found out 
on many an occasion, but more on that later. The 
body helps protect the camera, the electronics and 
the 2.4GHz video sender. The bodyshell is fixed on 
the bottom but pops into two rubber grommets on the 
top and two clips at the back which holds it firmly it 
in place. 

Sprouting from the main frames and the core of 
the frames are four booms with the mounting being 
very familiar to those that fly RC helis as the booms 
are clamped into place like that of a boom on a heli, 
sandwiched between the top and bottom plates and 
a plastic clamp. The booms have the motor mounts 
attached to the end which have a mark that allows 
you to align the angle of the motor mounts on the 
booms. The booms have marks to indicate the angle 
of the pods as they can be moved forwards to allow 
for the extreme of 250 flying, allowing for up to 30 
degrees of movement. 

The motors, which are 2300KV 1 806 (note 
optional 2206 motors and mounts are now 
available from Align), are mounted to the arm which 
incorporates a bunch of multicolour LEDs. These can 
be programmed to change colour through the app on 
the phones. The speed controllers are part of the main 
board and are connected via plugs and cables in the 
booms. Under the motor mounts are funky little plastic 
stands with rubber feet. 

Moving back to the centre of the machine you 


have the top deck which is where you mount the 
battery and hold it in place with a Velcro strap. At 
the rear you have the antenna mount for the 5.8GHz 
video sender and right at the back there are two 
more LEDs and a power button. The power button is 
a soft switch which doubles as a battery check 
indicator thanks to the four LEDs 
above it. 

Moving up to the front we 
have the camera control 
board which allows some 
changes of settings, but 
more importantly allows for 
the insertion of an SD card 
so you can record those 
flights right from the model. 

In-between the bottom 
and top plates right at 
the front is the all-important 
camera which is mounted to 
servo that allows for movement of 
the camera up and down. This can be 
done on the fly, or fixed in position via the 
app or it can even stabilise itself during flight to give 
that perfect vision, although this is tricky to fly with 
as you can lose your horizon, although Align have 
thought about that with the artificial horizon on the 
screen, clever stuff! 

The bottom deck is where most of the magic 
happens with all of the speed controllers, sensors and 
funky stuff, mostly connected via ribbon cables and 
pins to the things on the upper deck like the camera. 
That's pretty much it other than to talk about the 
camera and the video sender. 

The video sender is at the rear of the top deck 


and you can change the channels with a simple push 
button so you can make sure you don't clash with 
your friends down the field, very simple and much 
easier than dip switches. The best thing of all is that it 
is good to go! 

This thing is super simple in its design. There 
are some really well thought out things 
here which I really like, including: 
the camera and gimbal is pretty 
cool; the hard bodyshell 
protecting the camera; 
funky LEDs all over; built-in 
recording; and some 
amazing on screen display 
functions. 

FPV AND OSD 

Another one of the dark arts 
of FPV flying is the on-screen 
display, getting that shiznit 
to work is a tricky affair and 
requires much Googling and playing / 
tweaking and testing. We are talking voltage, 
amps pulled, the horizon and a whole host of other 
handy things you might need to use to be kept well 
informed whilst flying. This is again something that 
works right out of the box and you now have the 
option to turn stuff off and on through the app as you 
see fit. Of course this is only relevant to the FPV mode 
when flying with a screen or goggles. 

GOGGLES 

In terms of picking up the signal to fly in FPV mode 
you basically need a 5.8GHz powered screen or 
goggles. There are a range on the market and they 




ON TEST - Align MR25 


have varying cost as well as quality. They are typically 
around £350 with antenna and batteries ready to go 
which makes them more than the quad, however, Align 
have come to the table with another couple of stunning 
options. 

Align are launching (actually just launched at the 
time of writing) a range of goggles and screens, the 
goggles are around £240 and are supposed to be 
of awesome spec and quality, but they have 
not stopped there. You also have the 
option for goggles that record 
the action for around £275 
and also an option to 
mount your phone 
in a cradle which 
becomes a screen 
for the headset. 

They do some 
funky stuff with 
the5.8GHz 
conversion and 
off you go. No 
prices on that 
one yet, but 
expect it to make 
this package the 
most complete and 
cost effective on the 
market. 

FLYING 

I should probably start this part of 
the review by admitting I am an old school 
heli pilot and I can fly any 250 racer course as fast 
remotely as I can looking through some FPV goggles. 
Arguably that probably makes me the perfect match to 
test this MR25 as we have kicked the absolute hell out 
of it, which is code for crashed it a lot! I was not the 
only tester as some more experienced FPV pilots were 
also allowed at the sticks, although it is worth noting I 


am now getting pretty handy! 

First flight at the field was for pictures of it flying so 
we took it easy for the first minute before I got bored 
and stuck it in the floor. 

In attitude mode this is a tame little thing, it has some 
power behind it when you punch it out of the hover, but 
out of the box it doesn't have enough of an angle to get 
it moving fast, making it an ideal 250 trainer, although 
on a windy day it may not be able to lean 

hard enough into the wind. Increasing 
the maximum angle of attack 
will mean you can make this 
thing move a lot quicker 
and again it can make 
it an ideal trainer in 
attitude mode. It's 
nice and soft out 
of the box, but 
you can liven it 
up if you need 
to, again through 
the app. So far 
so good! 

Next up we 
flicked it into the 
'Normal' mode to 
test this slightly more 
lively setting. It was 
not a million miles away 
from the attitude mode other 
than the fact when you push the 
cyclic stick over it goes all the way 
over, slowly, but it does go all the way over. To 
be honest it flies like a well set up racing quad with a 
NAZ and Clean Flight, not the perfect set up but 90% 
to 95% there, obviously some room for fine tuning and 
your own personal touch, hooning it around it will 
happily pull loops and do big old barrel rolls. When 
in this mode you can really wind on the speed as you 
get the angles on with the power applied and it really 



gulps up the space. You can also get around the racing 
tracks, but as you get quick you will want some more 
control response, you have two options, wind up the 
controls for 'Manual Normal' mode through the app on 
your smartphone or flick it in to 'Manual Sport' mode. 

This is where I stuck it in the floor, only from head 
height but it still went into the ground. You see I flicked 
the switch and it was so lively it caught me by surprise, 
so much so that I over controlled it and stuck it in the 
floor, it's been a while since I have done that in 25 
years of flying, but in it went. 

A quick dusting down and some mud removed and 
it was back in the air, very lively, but back in the air. I 
pulled the app out and wound up the exponential as 
well as winding down the rate of roll, the net result was 
a much better balance around centre and still lightning 
fast at the extremes. I am still getting used to it in the 
nutty manual mode and have far from mastered the FPV 
flying in this mode, but I am sure having a lot of fun 
learning some new skills. 

TOUGH MUDDA! 

Now this little beast is far tougher than I ever imagined. 
On test flight number five I had plucked up the courage 
to test out the different FPV settings so I asked my chief 
spotter to keep an eye on the model while I tweaked 
some settings (I was flying through the goggles). I 
had hit the wrong buttons on the transmitter which 
resulted in me looking up at the sky on a very windy 
day. I verbally checked in with my spotter (Aaron) who 
assured me all was okay. I then heard a thud, some 
saw some tree through the goggles, took the goggles 
off looked up and saw the MR25 falling out of a tree 
from around 30 metres right on to a concrete floor! I 
was expecting the worst and I expected the spare parts 
to be something along the lines of the plastic shell, 
props, motor arms (the booms) and possibly even the 
main board. But after some brief words with my spotter, 
words along the lines of, what the hell? Where was my 
warning? Dude, it hit a tree 200 metres away! Once 


DroneZone rotonjuorld.co.uk 



we got over to the model we were presented with the 
bodyshell off, the battery out of the model, a broken 
prop and that was it. We put the battery back, snapped 
the body back in place, changed the prop and it was 
ready to go again. The camera was fine, the board 
was fine and some 30 flights later and another number 
of crashes it is still going strong. That bodyshell is not 
just for show. 

Initially and on paper I thought that the MR25 might 
have some weak spots, like the booms but I 
have been proved wrong time after time 
although it does seem to attract a lot 
of mud when it hits the floor! ^ 

THE VERDICT... i 

I started this article by ^ I 

mentioning the dark arts of f jl 

250 quads and racing, so I jH|| 

much to think about and so I 

much to fiddle with, for some 1 * 

they love it! For me, I just % 

want to get out and play and \ 

this is where the Align MR25 

comes into its own. 

Some would argue that a 3s 
setup is lagging behind but the ability 
to now run 4s should please many people 
and mean that it has legs for the future as you get 
better, but trust me it is more than up to racing for most 
people. It has already evolved in the short 2 months of 
release to have more options, so expect more upgrades 
to come for the MR25, it is just a matter of time! 

With regards to FPV mode we love the ability to 
capture on board shots with the built in SD card, it 
works a treat, new controls seem to be coming for the 
camera which is great news. The picture quality is 
superb and the picture is very good, little to no lagging, 
right up there with the best systems, if no one of the best 
although in extreme cases the camera needs to react 
faster to light changes, but we have seen an update for 
this already. The camera moving on the gimbal to auto 
level takes some getting used to but if you can persist it 


is worth the effort. 

So you have an out of the box solution that just 
works. Get some goggles, a boat load of props and off 
you go. You will need those props as they break when 
you hit the floor, something has to give, but they are 
only around £4 for a pack of two sets (eight props). 

Summing up, they have hit all the sweet spots, all of 
the things you could wish for and then some. I love the 
app on your phone, the camera, the OSD and 
of course the fact it is as hard as nails, 
and in my opinion the best 250 
racer yet and at £299 ready 
to rumble you would be 
hard pushed to make one 
\ yourself one as cheaply 
\ that performs as well 

^ ^ 1 

I board. Bottom line is 

I that it just works! Spares 
k f are already readily 

I available and batteries 
M are very cheap and 
^ acceptable, be this Align 
or some other brand. 

WOULD I? 

I have been playing with 250 quads 
for about a year with varying success, the 
MR25 is great and is right up my street. 

It has to be the best 250 FPV trainer and one of the 
most robust and capable out there. So the answer it a 
big fat yes with knobs on. You need one! 

If I were spending my hard earner cash on one then 
this would get my vote and I would be happy to buy 
and own it. 

THE BEST BIT! 

Expect to see an Align Racing league this year, it 
will need to be a stock machine but rumour has it the 
top two from the UK will get the opportunity to go to 
Taiwan for the Align cup, and invitational event with 
$30,000 prize funds! So get practising! •

ON TEST -Turnigy 2K Black 


A 



SHAUN GARRITYTESTS OUT A NEWANDVERY REASONABLY PRICED ENTRY INTO THE HD MICRO ACTION CAMERA 
riARKET IN THE SHAPE OFTHETURNIGY 2K BLACK FROM HOBBY KING 


B ack in 1 994 Apple brought the QuickTake 
1 00 to market. It was one of the very first 
consumer digital cameras. It could take eight 
pictures on a memory cord at the phenomenal 
resolution of O.Smegopixel, cost $750 and only 
interfaced with Macs, (that's about £850 today). It 
wasn't o success as the image quality was poor, it 
didn't have a preview screen and was about the size of 
a pair of binoculars. Three years after its introduction, 
it was canned when Steve Jobs returned to run the 
company. Still its introduction signalled the start of the 
end of traditional film based cameras. 

It wasn't that long ago that the Action Cam market 
was basically ruled by GoPro. They had achieved the 
same status as Xerox when it was common practice 
to refer to a photocopy as o 


market and these terms are still in common use today. 
This level of brand association is no mean feat in a 
competitive and crowded marketplace. A certain car 
manufacturer capitalised on this with on advert that 
stated, "if it doesn't say Volkswagen then it isn't a 
Volkswagen" inferring that similar products just couldn't 
step up to the mark. That may or not be the case in the 
car world, but the new Turnigy Black Edition 2K HD 
Action Cam is something else. 

ENTER THE NEW CONTENDER 

The 2K Black is the next generation video camera from 
Hobby King; having the same measurements as earlier 
1 080P Turnigy HD and HD Wi-Fi Action Cams, it is 
very similar to the GoPro Hero 3 camera, but not fully 
interchangeable with it. Other than the dimensional 


gimbals it will fit that are readily available and perform 
well without paying a fortune. 

The price and specs of the 2K Block ore impressive with 
2Khigh resolution recording atSOfps, 1 080pand720pat 
60fpswithimageresolutionsof 1 2MP(4032x3024), 1 OMP 
(3648x2736),8MP(3264x2448),5MP(2592xl944),3MP, 
2MHD, VGA, 1 .3MP. 

There are two versions available, the Lite and Full, 

I got the full package. I'm not big on packaging but 
you can't fail to be impressed by the presentation. The 
expensive looking gloss and matt black outer box opens 
to reveal 3 very plain white ones. 

Box one had the camera in, well protected in foam 
with peel off covers for the rear screen, lens and the 
waterproof case lens to stop them getting scratched 
in transit.. The second one hod multiple mounting 



differences, the GoPro uses a mini USB, the Turnigy a accessories, in fact so many I struggled to fit them 

micro USB also the HDMI ports are located in different back in later. Finally the third one has the manual, 

positions so if you already hove a GoPro gimbal, USB cable, cleaning cloth and a strap. With the Lite 

potentially it won't fit. Fortunately there are many package you basically just get the camera. 





Even the box 
looks stylish 


Like Russian 


nesting dolls, 
boxes within 


boxes 







includes a water 
proof case and 
a whole host of 
mounting brackets 


SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON 

The first thing you can't fail to notice is the view screen 
on the rear of the camera. I've always found the lack of 
this feature on my GoPro One an annoyance, not been 
able to line up the shot properly or review what you've 
taken immediately without having a tablet or laptop 
on hand. Another great feature is the diamond pattern 
texturing on the case giving a non slip surface. 

The 2K Black won't fit in a GoPro waterproof 
housing, but why would you want to when Turnigy have 
provided their own. This is included in the full package 
along with the aforementioned truck load of mounting 


accessories. The Turnigy waterproof housing is rated 
down to 30 metres so if you ditch your multi-rotor it in 
a lake at least you can watch it been ruined, (assuming 
you can recover it)! One feature I like on the waterproof 
case is the spring lock to prevent accidentally opening it. 

Checking side-by-side, GoPro fastenings appear 
a little thicker so you can use Turnigy items in GoPro 
pieces but not the other way around. To be honest I'm 
not sure why you would want to, I only found out by 
accident when I mixed some up and wasn't bothered 
enough to start testing every combination. 


BOX OF TRICKS 

Features without benefits are pretty pointless, but every 
feature on the 2K Black has hit the mark as far as I'm 
concerned and makes this camera a great all rounder. 
Besides all the standard camera stuff some of my 
favourites are as follows: 

Gyro Stabilisation - You can see how effective this is 
by direct comparison of the same shot. It works really 
well. Other cameras have this feature but as far as I 
know (getting ready to be shot down in flames here), 
the GoPro 3 doesn't. Turned on this is useful if your 
camera is mounted in the model not using a gimbal as

One of the 6 menu screens. I particularly like 
the slowmo feature

useful and can help combat jello issues

it certainly improves the final video quality. 

Stills Photography - Image quality up to 1 2MP (4032 
X 3024) 

Burst Mode - 3,5,10, or 30 images at one press. 

Digital Zoom - Activated by pressing the buttons on the 
camera side you can zoom up to 400% 

Wi-Fi - Simply download the free Android / lOS opp 
to your tablet or phone and you con do oil sorts of 
things such os, remote viewing, controlling the camera 
settings, start -stop recording. As on example of one 
application that springs to mind is actually seeing what 
you ore filming in almost real time (some Wi-Fi induced 
latency is evident) when wearing the 2K Block os o 


body or cop com to record your flights etc. I've wasted 
so many videos in the post where oil you could see was 
my feet or the ground. 

Slow-Mo - Up to 8 times slower than normal, you con 
create some brilliant effects. 

Video Lapse - Shoot every 1 ,2,5.1 0,30 or 60 seconds, 
this allows you to moke on easy time lapse video 
Wide Dynamic Range - WDR allows the cameras 
electronics to automatically adjust the exposure to 
maintain optimum detail in both the shadows and 
highlights. I hove found this definitely improves images 
when flying through wooded areas etc. 


GoPro I, Turnigy 2 K Black and GoPro 3+ 
for comparison. 

Although the 2 K Black is a little deeper than the 
Hero 3+, remember it has a LCD View Screen 





The screen and WiFi capability sets it apart 
from many contenders 


THE VERDICT... 

I always find it difficult to be subjective when discussing image quality. Ok, it's easy to see if it's blurred, but colour 
palette is o different thing. For example, I like the image on my Samsung TV better than my Sony. Compared with 
the GoPro 3-i-, on like for like resolution and the some subject, the colours of recorded video from the 2K Block look 
preferable to me and the definition of the image sharper. However the default white balance is possibly set o little 
cool and to me needs tweaking. 

It seems to cope with sun glare better than my GoPro 1 and it boots up ready for use almost instantaneously. 

I also found the audio to be sharper than overage, but again, that con be down to the individual. 

If you use the live video feature there appears to be o little latency evident so I wouldn't recommend it for the 
fastest quods but for general FPV use or larger / slower multirotors it would be o great solution .You need to 
purchase the optional Turnigy HD ActionCom FPV live video out A/V coble to do this. 

The killer feature though is the Wi-Fi connectivity for viewing and changing the camera parameters. Once you've 
used the opp you will wonder how you managed without it. 


Turnigy Black Edition 2K HD Action Cam 


The only modification I could suggest would be to hove the SD Cord slot, USB and HDMI ports under o flop to 
afford some protection from dirt etc. but to be fair, this isn't on issue when you use the waterproof cose. Also maybe

some tweaking of the firmware as occasionally the raw image looks over exposed in bright light conditions. 

Hobby King's advertising info says it's an ideal general action camera for photography, sports photography and 
aerial video, and when combined with 2D or 3D gimbals it provides the perfect aerial video solution for multi-rotors 
such as the Quanum Nova. Producing crisp quality video and still images, the Turnigy 2K HD is a high quality, 
great value action cam that will more than meet the needs of the serious hobby/sport videographer / photographer. 

Having used the camera for a month or so now, I have to agree. It offers brilliant value for money, great 
performance its well made and as previously mentioned feature rich. All in all, I really like it and for the money I 
would find it hard to justify buying a GoPro to film my FPV flights. ■

ON TEST - Rakon Heli 250 Quad Frame 




L ast year I bought the Horizon Blade 200QX quod 
and quickly found out that it was great for indoor 
and outdoor use, bogs of fun to fly, but it hod o 
fundamental problem; the monocoque frame was mode 
from o plastic material that exhibited strength properties 
not dissimilar to dried spaghetti. Okay, maybe I'm 
being o little unkind and it didn't stop me flying it so 
often that I wore out the original motors. However with 
only slight provocation from immovable objects such 
as the floor selfishly jumping up to attack it, the frame 
would break. What compounded the 'spending lots 
of money on replacement frame problem' was when 
I upgraded the firmware and props to allow full 3D 
flight. I hod to moke o choice, sell it or start looking at 
some of the aftermarket carbon fibre frames to toughen 
it up. After o quick bit of Googling I come across the 


After some research, taking on board oil the advice 
offered on various forums and then assuming 50 per 
cent was posted by people who haven't even seen 
one in the flesh; it still appeared that this frame was 
pretty outstanding. I was convinced and ordered one 
immediately, (if you ore interested I reviewed it in 
Rotorworld issue 109). 

200QX FRAME ON STEROIDS 

The 250 frame is basically o morphed version of the 
200 frame but now gives you the choice of motors, 
ESCs, flight controllers and LiPos. As such it con be built 
in o range of performance variants from sensible to 
outrageous, (outrageous is always good in my book). 

The CNC frame kit is mode of anodized aluminium 
alloy, carbon fibre, Delrin, steel hardware and has 
ond 

There ore two basic versions available; the 
difference is the undercarriage style. You hove o wide 
range of colours for the anodised ports to choose from 
n d 

vinyl skins to odd your own twist and produce o unique 
styled model. 

Supplied os o frame kit, Rokon hove put together o 
useful list of suitable hardware options for the 
electronics with motors ranging from 1306 - 


1 806, 7Amp to 20Amp ESCs, flight controllers such as 
the CC3D Atom, Naze 32 or Nano Wii, 2S to 3S LiPos 
and 5in props. 

There is very limited space available for everything so 
I would suggest this isn't for the beginner unless you con 
get some advice from on experienced multi-rotor fan. 

You also need to have some basic soldering skill as 
the ESCs are soldered directly to a power distribution 
board (PDB) and the motors, no space for plugs and 
sockets. 

As can be seen the part count for the frame is fairly 
low but some of the fasteners used are very small 
(1 .2mm X 5mm). It's important to make sure you have 
the correct sized screwdrivers etc. otherwise you could 
shear the head if you apply too much force. 

NOT ARTF FOR A CHANGE 

For the Delrin parts I would run the correct screw 
into the pre drilled hole first to cut the thread prior to 
assembly. Start by fixing the four carbon tube mounts 
the lower frame along with Delrin frame supports. Next 
mount the PDB (with 4 x 3mm Nylon screws and nuts). 

If you bought the 02 version of the kit you can now 
mount the undercarriage legs. I had to slightly trim the 
nylon screw heads to allow the struts to locate correctly 
but these were from my stock and not from Rakon. I

would guess that the Rakon items will be perfect. Next 
you need to fit the carbon tube arms into the frame 
mounts. I fixed the CNC motor mounts to the arms first 
but it doesn't matter if you do this after. Make sure 
you have the tubes the correct way round with the slot 
pointing down and the motor mounts correctly oriented. 
Also don't forget to put the O rings that hold the ESCs 
in place onto the tube otherwise you will be dismantling 
things later to do it. 

Get the soldering iron on for the next job. As 
mentioned the motors need soldering to the esc's 
and the ESCs to the PDB. Before you cover the joints 
with heat-shrink check the motors are spinning in the 
correct direction for their intended location. When this 


is done it wouldn't harm to range the ESCs 
by plugging them into the throttle output 
on the Rx and going through the appropriate 
procedure. One point, use a heat gun to shrink 
the heat-shrink tubing not a naked flame. This never 
works out well, looks terrible and can cause damage 
to surrounding components. Don't forget to leave a 
little extra cable so you can easily manoeuvre things 
around if you need to and it also makes installation 
easier. Slide the O-rings over the ESCs and the job 
is done. If the esc's you have used are an Opto 
type, Rakon sell a small 2A BEC so don't forget to 
solder that in place as we. It's not hard to keep things 
neat: have a look at the photo to see how I did it.

was accurately drilled (and tapped where required), 
the machining of the carbon fibre components truly 
excellent, and nothing had to be modified at oil. 

THE BIT MOST PEOPLE READ FIRST! 

So how did it fly then? I hadn't played around with the 
default settings on the flight controller and decided to 
see how it behaved. To be honest, I was a little unsure 
and thought I could possibly be in for o lot of tuning but 
it flew great. It's not optimally tweaked at the moment 
but very flyoble. With my power set up it really moves; 
the acceleration is blistering and vertically it's o tiny dot

close in flying outside then the CC3D Atom 
is fine. I also hod the opportunity to test its 
robustness. I let a mote hove o go and it 
didn't end well, the canopy had some 
minor crazing but surprisingly nothing 
else broke. The 250 is every bit os 
strong os the 200QX and yet again 
the DAL props survived with no

indestructible soles pitch. Guess 
what, he crashed because he was

SHAUN GARRITY FOLLOWS UP HIS REVIEW OFTHE EAGLE TREE VECTOR FIGHT CONTROLLER GPS 
MODULE FROMTHE LAST ISSUE, WITH ATEST OFTHE NEW AND IMPROVED SECOND VERSION 



■ reviewed the Eagle Tree Vector flight controller in 
the lost issue. What I like about this company is the 
on going innovation evident in their products and 
their commitment to continual improvement on both 
hardware and software fronts, never standing still. 

At the time the GPS / Magnetometer unit included 
in the Vector package was considered state of the art. 
They compared the performance of the VI GPS to some 
of the leading brand units in the market and found it to 
be os good or better to oil the competitors units tested. 

My personal experiences hove been great with 
the Vector / VI combo, having no obvious issues 
whatsoever. In fact it has become my 'go to' flight 
controller for anything other than sub 300 FPV racing 
quods and 3D or general Sport quods. Since the 
Vector's initial release, dual system GPS modules 
hove become available (and affordable) offering o 
step forward in terms of capability, 
especially in less than ideal situations. 

GPS performance is dependant on o 
number of factors; where it is located 
on the aircraft (they ore susceptible to 
radio frequency interference - RFI), 
terrain and atmospheric conditions. 

GLONASS NOT GLASNOST 

Eagle Tree started testing the V2 GPS 
in May lost year, with good results. At 
the some time DJI hod announced o 


switch to dual mode in the Phantom 3. 

The V2 GPS / Magnetometer now simultaneously 
receives and monitors both GPS and GLONASS. 

For those not familiar GLONASS (Globolnoyo 
Novigotsionnoya Sputnikovoyo 
Sistemo or GLObol NAvigation 
Satellite System), is o space- 
based satellite navigation system used 
by the Russian Aerospace Defence 
Forces. Its development began in 
the Soviet Union in 1 976. On 1 2th 
October 1 982 the first satellites were 
launched until the system constellation 
was completed in 1 995. In 2001 , 
Vladimir Putin made it o government 
priority to update and improve the 


system. By 2010, GLONASS hod achieved 100 per 
cent coverage of Russia's territory and by October 
201 1 full global coverage with 24 satellites providing 
the necessary hardware platform. They are firing 
around the planet at o height of approximately 
19,000Km. 

Manufacturers of GPS devices soy that adding 
GLONASS mode more satellites available to them, 
meaning positions con be fixed more quickly and 
accurately, especially in built-up areas where the 
view to some GPS satellites is obscured by buildings. 
Smartphones generally tend to use the same chipsets and 
since the versions used since 2015 receive GLONASS 
signals, smartphones using such chips receive 
GLONASS positioning information along with GPS. 



Locked solidly in space. 
The V2 has impressive 
performance even in 
blustery conditions 










**lmproved, superior performance...** 


NEW FEATURES 

The GPS/Mag V2 is compatible with all Vector systems, 
after a firmware update. Vector software version 1 1 .78 
or higher is required for correct GPS V2 operation. You 
can download it at www.eagletreesystems.com/index. 
php?route=common/home 

The V2 dual satellite system offers the following benefits: 

• Improved position accuracy for more precise hovering 
and tracking 

• Improved RFI rejection - especially with noisy video 
transmitters and cameras 

• Faster fix time 

• Up to 24 satellites in view 

As satellites are continually moving in low orbit, 
functions like Loiter and RTH are dependant on a good 
fix so by now having two different systems to reference 
reliability of these functions are significantly improved. 

PLUGGED IN AND WORKING 

So what's it like in use then? It is a simple replacement, 
just unclip and unplug your old module and the V2 
simply clips and plugs back in place, (remember to 


perform the firmware update). In operation it certainly 
seems to acquire satellite fix quicker. Don't forget 
though; even with the improvements you must still install 
the V2 as described in the manual to ensure there 
are no issues with RFI. With the VI, Return to Home 
(RTH) accuracy and Hover always seemed great but it 
now appears even better. All Vector systems are now 
shipped with the updated module but if you had the 
older one like me, I considered it a small price to pay 
for the improved, superior performance. I would think 
this especially important if you are using your multi-rotor 
for professional or semi professional videography. Oh 


just in case you were wondering, it is only 
with the Vector flight controller.
