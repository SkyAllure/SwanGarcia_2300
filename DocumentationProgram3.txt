For part A of the assignment we both contributed to the program. Swan came up with the plan and how we would implement everything. Anthony, did more of the actual calculations and more of the coding. Together we came up with generating a 3x3 matrix that would rotate around the z axis. We also generated another 3x3 matrix that would rotate around the y axis. We then multiplied these two matrices to form one matrix rotation. Using the midpoint (1500, 2000) we found out what the offset was. Then took the offset divided by the row number and column number. From there it was multiplied by the length of the sensor. The axis x, y and z were divided by 1000 to get them in meters. We took the x, y, and z axis and multiplied it by the matrix rotation, from the first part. We then used those points and multiplied by the conversions Boult gave us. Then we found where the lines intersect with the ground plane and that resulted in our points on the ground. 
For part B of the assignment we unfortunately did not know how to code it. We know that we need to create two lines closes to the ground and tilt 45 degrees into the sky and is perpendicular to the sensor. That is the part we did not know how to do. However, if we would have known how to create those lines then we would have used those lines to find where they intersect. Which would have found the main plane and the shadow plane. And lastly, we would have gotten the points by converting the meters back into latitude and longitude. It was the coding aspect we did not understand in part B, but we did understand the method behind it.
The grading should be split evenly (50/50) because we work as a team on everything that was explained above and it took both the implementation and calculations to complete part A.
