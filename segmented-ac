Esperanto is also the language of instruction in one university, the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj in San Marino.
History
Esperanto was developed in the late 1870s and early 1880s by ophthalmologist Dr. Ludovic Lazarus Zamenhof, an Ashkenazi Jew from Bialystok, now in Poland and previously in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but at the time part of the Russian Empire.
After some ten years of development, which Zamenhof spent translating literature into the language as well as writing original prose and verse, the first book of Esperanto grammar was published in Warsaw in July 1887.
The number of speakers grew rapidly over the next few decades, at first primarily in the Russian empire and Eastern Europe, then in Western Europe, the Americas, China, and Japan.
In the early years, speakers of Esperanto kept in contact primarily through correspondence and periodicals, but in 1905 the first world congress of Esperanto speakers was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France.
Since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year, except during the two World Wars.
Since the Second World War, they have been attended by an average of over 2000 and up to 6000 people.
Relation to 20th-century totalitarianism
As a potential vehicle for international understanding, Esperanto attracted the suspicion of many totalitarian states.
The situation was especially pronounced in Nazi Germany and in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin.
In Germany, there was additional motivation to persecute Esperanto because Zamenhof was a Jew.
In his work Mein Kampf, Hitler mentioned Esperanto as an example of a language that would be used by an International Jewish Conspiracy once they achieved world domination.
Esperantists were executed during the Holocaust, with Zamenhof's family in particular singled out for execution.
In the early years of the Soviet Union, Esperanto was given a measure of government support, and an officially recognized Soviet Esperanto Association came into being.
However, in 1937, Stalin reversed this policy.
He denounced Esperanto as "the language of spies" and had Esperantists executed.
The use of Esperanto remained illegal until 1956.
Official use
Esperanto has never been an official language of any recognized country.
However, there were plans at the beginning of the 20th century to establish Neutral Moresnet as the world's first Esperanto state.
In China, there was talk in some circles after the 1911 Xinhai Revolution about officially replacing Chinese with Esperanto as a means to dramatically bring the country into the twentieth century, though this policy proved untenable.
In the summer of 1924, the American Radio Relay League adopted Esperanto as its official international auxiliary language, and hoped that the language would be used by radio amateurs in international communications, but its actual use for radio communications was negligible.
In addition, the self-proclaimed artificial island micronation of Rose Island used Esperanto as its official language in 1968.
Esperanto is the working language of several non-profit international organizations such as the Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda, but most others are specifically Esperanto organizations.
The largest of these, the World Esperanto Association, has an official consultative relationship with the United Nations and UNESCO.
The U.S. Army has published military phrasebooks in Esperanto, to be used in wargames by mock enemy forces.
Esperanto is also the first language of teaching and administration of the International Academy of Sciences San Marino, which is sometimes called an "Esperanto University".
Linguistic properties
Classification
As a constructed language, Esperanto is not genealogically related to any ethnic language.
It has been described as "a language lexically predominantly Romanic, morphologically intensively agglutinative and to a certain degree isolating in character".
The phonology, grammar, vocabulary, and semantics are based on the western Indo-European languages.
The phonemic inventory is essentially Slavic, as is much of the semantics, while the vocabulary derives primarily from the Romance languages, with a lesser contribution from the Germanic languages.
Pragmatics and other aspects of the language not specified by Zamenhof's original documents were influenced by the native languages of early speakers, primarily Russian, Polish, German, and French.
Typologically, Esperanto has prepositions and a pragmatic word order that by default is Subject Verb Object and Adjective Noun.
New words are formed through extensive prefixing and suffixing.
Writing system
Esperanto is written with a modified version of the Latin alphabet, including six letters with diacritics: ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ and ŭ (that is, c, g, h, j, s circumflex, and u breve).
The alphabet does not include the letters q, w, x, or y except in unassimilated foreign names.
The 28-letter alphabet is: a b c ĉ d e f g ĝ h ĥ i j ĵ k l m n o p r s ŝ t u ŭ v z
All letters are pronounced approximately as in the IPA, with the exception of c and the accented letters:
Two ASCII-compatible writing conventions are in use.
These substitute digraphs for the accented letters.
The original "h-convention" (ch, gh, hh, jh, sh, u) is based on English 'ch' and 'sh', while a more recent "x-convention" (cx, gx, hx, jx, sx, ux) is useful for alphabetic word sorting on a computer (cx comes correctly after cu, sx after sv, etc.) as well as for simple conversion back into the standard orthography.
Another scheme represents the superscripted letters by a caret (^), as for example: c^ or ^c.
Phonology
(For help with the phonetic symbols, see Help:IPA)
Esperanto has 22 consonants, 5 vowels, and two semivowels, which combine with the vowels to form 6 diphthongs.
(The consonant <ipa/> and semivowel <ipa/> are both written <j>.)
Tone is not used to distinguish meanings of words.
Stress is always on the penultimate vowel, unless a final vowel o is elided, a practice which occurs mostly in poetry.
For example, familio "family" is stressed <ipa/>, but when found without the final o, famili’, the stress does not shift: <ipa/>.
Consonants
The 22 consonants are:
The sound <ipa/> is usually rolled, but may be tapped <ipa/>.
The <ipa/> has a normative pronunciation like an English v, but is sometimes somewhere between a v and a w, <ipa/>, depending on the language background of the speaker.
A semivowel <ipa/> normally occurs only in diphthongs after the vowels <ipa/> and <ipa/>, not as a consonant <ipa/>.
Common, if debated, assimilation includes the pronunciation of <ipa/> as <ipa/>, as in English sink, and <ipa/> as <ipa/>, like the x in English example.
A large number of consonant clusters can occur, up to three in initial position and four in medial position, as in instrui "to teach".
Final clusters are uncommon except in foreign names, poetic elision of final o, and a very few basic words such as cent "hundred" and post "after".
Vowels
Esperanto has the five cardinal vowels of Spanish, Swahili, and Modern Greek.
There are six falling diphthongs: uj, oj, ej, aj, aŭ, eŭ (<ipa/>).
With only five vowels, a good deal of variation is tolerated.
For instance, <ipa/> commonly ranges from <ipa/> (French é) to <ipa/> (French è).
The details often depend on the speaker's native language.
A glottal stop may occur between adjacent vowels in some people's speech, especially when the two vowels are the same, as in heroo "hero" (<ipa/> or <ipa/>) and praavo "great-grandfather" (<ipa/> or <ipa/>).
Grammar
Esperanto words are derived by stringing together prefixes, roots, and suffixes.
This process is regular, so that people can create new words as they speak and be understood.
Compound words are formed with a modifier-first, head-final order, the same order as English "birdsong" vs. "songbird".
The different parts of speech are marked by their own suffixes: all common nouns end in -o, all adjectives in -a, all derived adverbs in -e, and all verbs in one of six tense and mood suffixes, such as present tense -as.
Plural nouns end in -oj (pronounced "oy"), whereas direct objects end in -on.
Plural direct objects end with the combination -ojn (pronounced to rhyme with "coin"): That is, -o for a noun, plus -j for plural, plus -n for direct object.
Adjectives agree with their nouns; their endings are plural -aj (pronounced "eye"), direct-object -an, and plural direct-object -ajn (pronounced to rhyme with "fine").
The suffix -n is used to indicate the goal of movement and a few other things, in addition to the direct object.
See Esperanto grammar for details.
The six verb inflections consist of three tenses and three moods.
They are present tense -as, future tense -os, past tense -is, infinitive mood -i, conditional mood -us, and jussive mood -u (used for wishes and commands).
Verbs are not marked for person or number.
For instance: kanti "to sing"; mi kantas "I sing"; mi kantis "I sang"; mi kantos "I will sing"; li kantas "he sings"; vi kantas "you sing".
Word order is comparatively free: Adjectives may precede or follow nouns, and subjects, verbs and objects (marked by the suffix -n) may occur in any order.
However, the article la "the" and demonstratives such as tiu "this, that" almost always come before the noun, and a preposition such as ĉe "at" must come before it.
Similarly, the negative ne "not" and conjunctions such as kaj "both, and" and ke "that" must precede the phrase or clause they introduce.
In copular (A = B) clauses, word order is just as important as it is in English clauses like "people are dogs" vs. "dogs are people".
Correlatives
A correlative is a word used to ask or answer a question of who, where, what, when, or how.
Correlatives in Esperanto are set out in a systematic manner that correlates a basic idea (quantity, manner, time, etc.) to a function (questioning, indicating, negating, etc.)
Examples:
Kio estas tio?
"What is this?"
Kioma estas la horo?
"What time is it?"
Note kioma rather than Kiu estas la horo? "which is the hour?", when asking for the ranking order of the hour on the clock.
Io falis el la ŝranko "Something fell out of the cupboard."
Homoj tiaj kiel mi ne konadas timon.
"Men such as me know no fear."
Correlatives are declined if the case demands it:
Vi devas elekti ian vorton pli simpla "You should choose a (some kind of) simpler word."
Ia receives -n because it's part of the direct object.
Kian libron vi volas?
"What sort of book do you want?"
Contrast this with, Kiun libron vi volas?
"Which book do you want?"
Vocabulary
The core vocabulary of Esperanto was defined by Lingvo internacia, published by Zamenhof in 1887.
It comprised 900 roots, which could be expanded into tens of thousands of words with prefixes, suffixes, and compounding.
In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto dictionary, Universala Vortaro, with a larger set of roots.
However, the rules of the language allowed speakers to borrow new roots as needed, recommending only that they look for the most international forms, and then derive related meanings from these.
Since then, many words have been borrowed, primarily but not solely from the Western European languages.
Not all proposed borrowings catch on, but many do, especially technical and scientific terms.
Terms for everyday use, on the other hand, are more likely to be derived from existing roots—for example komputilo (a computer) from komputi (to compute) plus the suffix -ilo (tool)—or to be covered by extending the meanings of existing words (for example muso (a mouse), as in English, now also means a computer input device).
There are frequent debates among Esperanto speakers about whether a particular borrowing is justified or whether the need can be met by deriving from or extending the meaning of existing words.
In addition to the root words and the rules for combining them, a learner of Esperanto must memorize some idiomatic compounds that are not entirely straightforward.
For example, eldoni, literally "to give out", is used for "to publish" (a calque of words in several European languages with the same derivation), and vortaro, literally "a collection of words", means "a glossary" or "a dictionary".
Such forms are modeled after usage in some European languages, and speakers of other languages may find them illogical.
Fossilized derivations inherited from Esperanto's source languages may be similarly obscure, such as the opaque connection the root word centralo "power station" has with centro "center".
Compounds with -um- are overtly arbitrary, and must be learned individually, as -um- has no defined meaning.
It turns dekstren "to the right" into dekstrumen "clockwise", and komuna "common/shared" into komunumo "community", for example.
Nevertheless, there are not nearly as many idiomatic or slang words in Esperanto as in ethnic languages, as these tend to make international communication difficult, working against Esperanto's main goal.

Sample text
The following short extract gives an idea of the character of Esperanto.
(Pronunciation is covered above.
The main point for English speakers to remember is that the letter 'J' has the sound of the letter 'Y' in English)
Esperanto text
En multaj lokoj de Ĉinio estis temploj de drako-reĝo. Dum trosekeco oni preĝis en la temploj, ke la drako-reĝo donu pluvon al la homa mondo.
Tiam drako estis simbolo de la supernatura estaĵo. Kaj pli poste, ĝi fariĝis prapatro de la plej altaj regantoj kaj simbolis la absolutan aŭtoritaton de feŭda imperiestro.
La imperiestro pretendis, ke li estas filo de la drako. Ĉiuj liaj vivbezonaĵoj portis la nomon drako kaj estis ornamitaj per diversaj drakofiguroj.
Nun ĉie en Ĉinio videblas drako-ornamentaĵoj kaj cirkulas legendoj pri drakoj.
English Translation:
In many places in China there were temples of the dragon king.
During times of drought, people prayed in the temples, that the dragon king would give rain to the human world.
At that time the dragon was a symbol of the supernatural.
Later on, it became the ancestor of the highest rulers and symbolised the absolute authority of the feudal emperor.
The emperor claimed to be the son of the dragon.
All of his personal possessions carried the name dragon and were decorated with various dragon figures.
Now everywhere in China dragon decorations can be seen and there circulate legends about dragons.
Education
The majority of Esperanto speakers learn the language through self-directed study, online tutorials, and correspondence courses taught by volunteers.
In more recent years, teaching websites like lernu! have become popular.
Esperanto instruction is occasionally available at schools, such as a pilot project involving four primary schools under the supervision of the University of Manchester, and by one count at 69 universities.
However, outside of China and Hungary, these mostly involve informal arrangements rather than dedicated departments or state sponsorship.
Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest had a department of Interlinguistics and Esperanto from 1966 to 2004, after which time instruction moved to vocational colleges; there are state examinations for Esperanto instructors.
Various educators have estimated that Esperanto can be learned in anywhere from one quarter to one twentieth the amount of time required for other languages.
Some argue, however, that this is only true for native speakers of Western European languages.
Claude Piron, a psychologist formerly at the University of Geneva and Chinese-English-Russian-Spanish translator for the United Nations, argued that Esperanto is far more "brain friendly" than many ethnic languages.
"Esperanto relies entirely on innate reflexes [and] differs from all other languages in that you can always trust your natural tendency to generalize patterns. [...]
The same neuropsychological law [— called by] Jean Piaget generalizing assimilation — applies to word formation as well as to grammar."
Language acquisition
Four primary schools in Britain, with some 230 pupils, are currently following a course in "propedeutic Esperanto", under the supervision of the University of Manchester.
That is, instruction in Esperanto to raise language awareness and accelerate subsequent learning of foreign languages.
Several studies demonstrate that studying Esperanto before another foreign language speeds and improves learning the second language to a greater extent than other languages which have been investigated.
This appears to be because learning subsequent foreign languages is easier than learning one's first, while the use of a grammatically simple and culturally flexible auxiliary language like Esperanto lessens the first-language learning hurdle.
In one study, a group of European secondary school students studied Esperanto for one year, then French for three years, and ended up with a significantly better command of French than a control group, who studied French for all four years.
Similar results were found when the course of study was reduced to two years, of which six months was spent learning Esperanto.
Results are not yet available from a study in Australia to see if similar benefits would occur for learning East Asian languages, but the pupils taking Esperanto did better and enjoyed the subject more than those taking other languages.
Community
Geography and demography
Esperanto speakers are more numerous in Europe and East Asia than in the Americas, Africa, and Oceania, and more numerous in urban than in rural areas.
Esperanto is particularly prevalent in the northern and eastern countries of Europe; in China, Korea, Japan, and Iran within Asia; in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico in the Americas; and in Togo in Africa.
Number of speakers
An estimate of the number of Esperanto speakers was made by the late Sidney S. Culbert, a retired psychology professor at the University of Washington and a longtime Esperantist, who tracked down and tested Esperanto speakers in sample areas in dozens of countries over a period of twenty years.
Culbert concluded that between one and two million people speak Esperanto at Foreign Service Level 3, "professionally proficient" (able to communicate moderately complex ideas without hesitation, and to follow speeches, radio broadcasts, etc.).
Culbert's estimate was not made for Esperanto alone, but formed part of his listing of estimates for all languages of over 1 million speakers, published annually in the World Almanac and Book of Facts.
Culbert's most detailed account of his methodology is found in a 1989 letter to David Wolff .
Since Culbert never published detailed intermediate results for particular countries and regions, it is difficult to independently gauge the accuracy of his results.
In the Almanac, his estimates for numbers of language speakers were rounded to the nearest million, thus the number for Esperanto speakers is shown as 2 million.
This latter figure appears in Ethnologue.
Assuming that this figure is accurate, that means that about 0.03% of the world's population speaks the language.
This falls short of Zamenhof's goal of a universal language, but it represents a level of popularity unmatched by any other constructed language.
Marcus Sikosek (now Ziko van Dijk) has challenged this figure of 1.6 million as exaggerated.
He estimated that even if Esperanto speakers were evenly distributed, assuming one million Esperanto speakers worldwide would lead one to expect about 180 in the city of Cologne.
Van Dijk finds only 30 fluent speakers in that city, and similarly smaller than expected figures in several other places thought to have a larger-than-average concentration of Esperanto speakers.
He also notes that there are a total of about 20,000 members of the various Esperanto organizations (other estimates are higher).
Though there are undoubtedly many Esperanto speakers who are not members of any Esperanto organization, he thinks it unlikely that there are fifty times more speakers than organization members.
Finnish linguist Jouko Lindstedt, an expert on native-born Esperanto speakers, presented the following scheme to show the overall proportions of language capabilities within the Esperanto community:
1,000 have Esperanto as their native language
10,000 speak it fluently
100,000 can use it actively
1,000,000 understand a large amount passively
10,000,000 have studied it to some extent at some time.
In the absence of Dr. Culbert's detailed sampling data, or any other census data, it is impossible to state the number of speakers with certainty.
Few observers, probably, would challenge the following statement from the website of the World Esperanto Association:
Numbers of textbooks sold and membership of local societies put the number of people with some knowledge of the language in the hundreds of thousands and possibly millions.
Native speakers
Ethnologue reports estimates that there are 200 to 2000 native Esperanto speakers (denaskuloj), who have learned the language from birth from their Esperanto-speaking parents.
This usually happens when Esperanto is the chief or only common language in an international family, but sometimes in a family of devoted Esperantists.
The most famous native speaker of Esperanto is businessman George Soros.
Also notable is young Holocaust victim Petr Ginz, whose drawing of the planet Earth as viewed from the moon was carried aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003 (STS-107).
Culture
Esperanto speakers can access an international culture, including a large body of original as well as translated literature.
There are over 25,000 Esperanto books, both originals and translations, as well as several regularly distributed Esperanto magazines.
Esperanto speakers use the language for free accommodations with Esperantists in 92 countries using the Pasporta Servo or to develop pen pal friendships abroad through the Esperanto Pen Pal Service.
Every year, 1,500-3,000 Esperanto speakers meet for the World Congress of Esperanto (Universala Kongreso de Esperanto).
The European Esperanto Union (Eǔropa Esperanto-Unio) regroups the national Esperanto associations of the EU member states and holds congresses every two years.
The most recent was in Maribor, Slovenia, in July-August 2007.
It attracted 256 delegates from 28 countries, including 2 members of the European Parliament, Ms. Małgorzata Handzlik of Poland and Ms. Ljudmila Novak of Slovenia.
Historically, much Esperanto music has been in various folk traditions, such as Kaj Tiel Plu, for example.
In recent decades, more rock and other modern genres have appeared, an example being the Swedish band Persone.
There are also shared traditions, such as Zamenhof Day, and shared behaviour patterns.
Esperantists speak primarily in Esperanto at international Esperanto meetings.
Detractors of Esperanto occasionally criticize it as "having no culture".
Proponents, such as Prof. Humphrey Tonkin of the University of Hartford, observe that Esperanto is "culturally neutral by design, as it was intended to be a facilitator between cultures, not to be the carrier of any one national culture."
The late Scottish Esperanto author William Auld has written extensively on the subject, arguing that Esperanto is "the expression of a common human culture, unencumbered by national frontiers.
Thus it is considered a culture on its own."
Others point to Esperanto's potential for strengthening a common European identity, as it combines features of several European languages.
In popular culture
Esperanto has been used in a number of films and novels.
Typically, this is done either to add the exotic flavour of a foreign language without representing any particular ethnicity, or to avoid going to the trouble of inventing a new language.
The Charlie Chaplin film The Great Dictator (1940) showed Jewish ghetto shops designated in Esperanto, each with the general Esperanto suffix -ejo (meaning "place for..."), in order to convey the atmosphere of some 'foreign' East European country without referencing any particular East European language.
Two full-length feature films have been produced with dialogue entirely in Esperanto: Angoroj, in 1964, and Incubus, a 1965 B-movie horror film.
Canadian actor William Shatner learned Esperanto to a limited level so that he could star in Incubus.
Other amateur productions have been made, such as a dramatisation of the novel Gerda Malaperis (Gerda Has Disappeared).
A number of "mainstream" films in national languages have used Esperanto in some way, such as Gattaca (1997), in which Esperanto can be overheard on the public address system.
In the 1994 film Street Fighter, Esperanto is the native language of the fictional country of Shadaloo, and in a barracks scene the soldiers of villain M. Bison sing a rousing Russian Army-style chorus, the "Bison Troopers Marching Song", in the language.
Esperanto is also spoken and appears on signs in the film Blade: Trinity.
In the British comedy Red Dwarf, Arnold Rimmer is seen attempting to learn Esperanto in a number of early episodes, including Kryten.
In the first season, signs on the titular spacecraft are in both English and Esperanto.
Esperanto is used as the universal language in the far future of Harry Harrison's Stainless Steel Rat and Deathworld stories.
In a 1969 guest appearance on The Tonight Show, Jay Silverheels of The Lone Ranger fame appeared in character as Tonto for a comedy sketch with Johnny Carson, and claimed Esperanto skills as he sought new employment.
The sketch ended with a statement of his ideal situation: "Tonto, to Toronto, for Esperanto, and pronto!"
Also, in the Danny Phantom Episode, "Public Enemies", Danny, Tucker, and Sam come across a ghost wolf who speaks Esperanto, but only Tucker can understand at first.
In Science
In 1921 the French Academy of Sciences recommended using Esperanto for international scientific communication.
A few scientists and mathematicians, such as Maurice Fréchet (mathematics), John C. Wells (linguistics), Helmar Frank (pedagogy and cybernetics), and Nobel laureate Reinhard Selten (economics) have published part of their work in Esperanto.
Frank and Selten were among the founders of the International Academy of Sciences in San Marino, sometimes called the "Esperanto University", where Esperanto is the primary language of teaching and administration.
Goals of the movement
Zamenhof's intention was to create an easy-to-learn language to foster international understanding.
It was to serve as an international auxiliary language, that is, as a universal second language, not to replace ethnic languages.
This goal was widely shared among Esperanto speakers in the early decades of the movement.
Later, Esperanto speakers began to see the language and the culture that had grown up around it as ends in themselves, even if Esperanto is never adopted by the United Nations or other international organizations.
Those Esperanto speakers who want to see Esperanto adopted officially or on a large scale worldwide are commonly called finvenkistoj, from fina venko, meaning "final victory", or pracelistoj, from pracelo, meaning "original goal".
Those who focus on the intrinsic value of the language are commonly called raŭmistoj, from Rauma, Finland, where a declaration on the near-term unlikelihood of the "fina venko" and the value of Esperanto culture was made at the International Youth Congress in 1980.
These categories are, however, not mutually exclusive.
The Prague Manifesto (1996) presents the views of the mainstream of the Esperanto movement and of its main organisation, the World Esperanto Association (UEA).
Symbols and flags
In 1893, C. Rjabinis and P. Deullin designed and manufactured a lapel pin for Esperantists to identify each other.
The design was a circular pin with a white background and a five pointed green star.
The theme of the design was the hope of the five continents being united by a common language.
The earliest flag, and the one most commonly used today, features a green five-pointed star against a white canton, upon a field of green.
It was proposed to Zamenhof by Irishman Richard Geoghegan, author of the first Esperanto textbook for English speakers, in 1887.
In 1905, delegates to the first conference of Esperantists at Boulogne-sur-Mer unanimously approved a version that differed from the modern flag only by the superimposition of an "E" over the green star.
Other variants include that for Christian Esperantists, with a white Christian cross superimposed upon the green star, and that for Leftists, with the color of the field changed from green to red.
In 1987, a second flag design was chosen in a contest organized by the UEA celebrating the first centennial of the language.
It featured a white background with two stylised curved "E"s facing each other.
Dubbed the "jubilea simbolo" (jubilee symbol) , it attracted criticism from some Esperantists, who dubbed it the "melono" (melon) because of the design's elliptical shape.
It is still in use, though to a lesser degree than the traditional symbol, known as the "verda stelo" (green star).
Religion
Esperanto has served an important role in several religions, such as Oomoto from Japan and Baha'i from Iran, and has been encouraged by others.
Oomoto
The Oomoto religion encourages the use of Esperanto among their followers and includes Zamenhof as one of its deified spirits.
Bahá'í Faith
The Bahá'í Faith encourages the use of an auxiliary international language.
While endorsing no specific language, some Bahá'ís see Esperanto as having great potential in this role.
Lidja Zamenhof, the daughter of Esperanto founder L. L. Zamenhof, became a Bahá'í.
Various volumes of the Bahá'í literatures and other Baha'i books have been translated into Esperanto.
Spiritism
Esperanto is also actively promoted, at least in Brazil, by followers of Spiritism.
The Brazilian Spiritist Federation publishes Esperanto coursebooks, translations of Spiritism's basic books, and encourages Spiritists to become Esperantists.
Bible translations
The first translation of the Bible into Esperanto was a translation of the Tanach or Old Testament done by L. L. Zamenhof.
The translation was reviewed and compared with other languages' translations by a group of British clergy and scholars before publishing it at the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1910.
In 1926 this was published along with a New Testament translation, in an edition commonly called the "Londona Biblio".
In the 1960s, the Internacia Asocio de Bibliistoj kaj Orientalistoj tried to organize a new, ecumenical Esperanto Bible version.
Since then, the Dutch Lutheran pastor Gerrit Berveling has translated the Deuterocanonical or apocryphal books in addition to new translations of the Gospels, some of the New Testament epistles, and some books of the Tanakh or Old Testament.
These have been published in various separate booklets, or serialized in Dia Regno, but the Deuterocanonical books have appeared in recent editions of the Londona Biblio.
Christianity
Two Roman Catholic popes, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, have regularly used Esperanto in their multilingual urbi et orbi blessings at Easter and Christmas each year since Easter 1994.
Christian Esperanto organizations include two that were formed early in the history of Esperanto, the International Union of Catholic Esperantists and the International Christian Esperantists League.
An issue of "The Friend" describes the activities of the Quaker Esperanto Society.
There are instances of Christian apologists and teachers who use Esperanto as a medium.
Nigerian Pastor Bayo Afolaranmi's "Spirita nutraĵo" (spiritual food) Yahoo mailing list, for example, has hosted weekly messages since 2003.
Chick Publications, publisher of Protestant fundamentalist themed evangelistic tracts, has published a number of comic book style tracts by Jack T. Chick translated into Esperanto, including "This Was Your Life!"
("Jen Via Tuto Vivo!")
Islam
Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran called on Muslims to learn Esperanto and praised its use as a medium for better understanding among peoples of different religious backgrounds.
After he suggested that Esperanto replace English as an international lingua franca, it began to be used in the seminaries of Qom.
An Esperanto translation of the Qur'an was published by the state shortly thereafter.
In 1981, Khomeini and the Iranian government began to oppose Esperanto after realising that followers of the Bahá'í Faith were interested in it.
Criticism
Esperanto was conceived as a language of international communication, more precisely as a universal second language.
Since publication, there has been debate over whether it is possible for Esperanto to attain this position, and whether it would be an improvement for international communication if it did.
There have been a number of attempts to reform the language, the most well-known of which is the language Ido which resulted in a schism in the community at the time, beginning in 1907.
Since Esperanto is a planned language, there have been many, often passionate, criticisms of minor points which are too numerous to cover here, such as Zamenhof's choice of the word edzo over something like spozo for "husband, spouse", or his choice of the Classic Greek and Old Latin singular and plural endings -o, -oj, -a, -aj over their Medieval contractions -o, -i, -a, -e.
(Both these changes were adopted by the Ido reform, though Ido dispensed with adjectival agreement altogether.)
See the links below for examples of more general criticism.
The more common points include:
Esperanto has failed the expectations of its founder to become a universal second language.
Although many promoters of Esperanto stress the few successes it has had, the fact remains that well over a century since its publication, the portion of the world that speaks Esperanto, and the number of primary and secondary schools which teach it, remain minuscule.
It simply cannot compete with English in this regard.
The vocabulary and grammar are based on major European languages, and are not universal.
Often this criticism is specific to a few points such as adjectival agreement and the accusative case (generally such obvious details are all that reform projects suggest changing), but sometimes it is more general: Both the grammar and the 'international' vocabulary are difficult for many Asians, among others, and give an unfair advantage to speakers of European languages.
One attempt to address this issue is Lojban, which draws from the six populous languages Arabic, Chinese, English, Hindi, Russian, and Spanish, and whose grammar is designed for computer parsing.
The vocabulary, diacritic letters, and grammar are too dissimilar from the major Western European languages, and therefore Esperanto is not as easy as it could be for speakers of those languages to learn.
Attempts to address this issue include the younger planned languages Ido and Interlingua.
Esperanto phonology is unimaginatively provincial, being essentially Belorussian with regularized stress, leaving out only the nasal vowels, palatalized consonants, and /dz/.
For example, Esperanto has phonemes such as <ipa/> (ĥ, ĵ, c, eŭ) which are rare as distinct phonemes outside Europe.
(Note that none of these are found in initial position in English.)
Esperanto has no culture.
Although it has a large international literature, Esperanto does not encapsulate a specific culture.
Esperanto is culturally European.
This is due to the European derivation of its vocabulary, and more insidiously, its semantics; both infuse the language with a European world view.
The vocabulary is too large.
Rather than deriving new words from existing roots, large numbers of new roots are adopted into the language by people who think they're international, when in fact they're only European.
This makes the language much more difficult for non-Europeans than it needs to be.
Esperanto is sexist.
As in English, there is no neutral pronoun for s/he, and most kin terms and titles are masculine by default and only feminine when so specified.
There have been many attempts to address this issue, of which one of the better known is Riism.
Esperanto is, looks, or sounds artificial.
This criticism is primarily due to the letters with circumflex diacritics, which some find odd or cumbersome, and to the lack of fluent speakers: Few Esperantists have spent much time with fluent, let alone native, speakers, and many learn Esperanto relatively late in life, and so speak haltingly, which can create a negative impression among non-speakers.
Among fluent speakers, Esperanto sounds no more artificial than any other language.
Others claim that an artificial language will necessarily be deficient, due to its very nature, but the Hungarian Academy of Sciences has found that Esperanto fulfills all the requirements of a living language.
Modifications
Though Esperanto itself has changed little since the publication of the Fundamento de Esperanto (Foundation of Esperanto), a number of reform projects have been proposed over the years, starting with Zamenhof's proposals in 1894 and Ido in 1907.
Several later constructed languages, such as Fasile, were based on Esperanto.
In modern times, attempts have been made to eliminate perceived sexism in the language.
One example of this is Riism.
However, as Esperanto has become a living language, changes are as difficult to implement as in ethnic languages.
Formal grammar
In formal semantics, computer science and linguistics, a formal grammar (also called formation rules) is a precise description of a formal language &ndash; that is, of a set of strings over some alphabet.
In other words, a grammar describes which of the possible sequences of symbols (strings) in a language constitute valid words or statements in that language, but it does not describe their semantics (i.e. what they mean).
The branch of mathematics that is concerned with the properties of formal grammars and languages is called formal language theory.
A grammar is usually regarded as a means to generate all the valid strings of a language; it can also be used as the basis for a recognizer that determines for any given string whether it is grammatical (i.e. belongs to the language).
To describe such recognizers, formal language theory uses separate formalisms, known as automata.
A grammar can also be used to analyze the strings of a language &ndash; i.e. to describe their internal structure.
In computer science, this process is known as parsing.
Most languages have very compositional semantics, i.e. the meaning of their utterances is structured according to their syntax; therefore, the first step to describing the meaning of an utterance in language is to analyze it and look at its analyzed form (known as its parse tree in computer science, and as its deep structure in generative grammar).
Background
Formal language
A formal language is an organized set of symbols the essential feature of which is that it can be precisely defined in terms of just the shapes and locations of those symbols.
Such a language can be defined, then, without any reference to any meanings of any of its expressions; it can exist before any formal interpretation is assigned to it -- that is, before it has any meaning.
First order logic is expressed in some formal language.
A formal grammar determines which symbols and sets of symbols are formulas in a formal language.
Formal systems
A formal system (also called a logical calculus, or a logical system) consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a deductive system).
The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules (also called inference rules) or a set of axioms, or have both.
A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions.
Formal proofs
A formal proof is a sequence of well-formed formulas of a formal language, the last one of which is a theorem of a formal system.
The theorem is a syntactic consequence of all the wffs preceding it in the proof.
For a wff to qualify as part of a proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the deductive apparatus of some formal system to the previous wffs in the proof sequence.
Formal interpretations
An interpretation of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and truth-values to the sentences of a formal system.
The study of formal interpretations is called formal semantics.
Giving an interpretation is synonymous with constructing a model.
Formal grammars
A grammar mainly consists of a set of rules for transforming strings.
(If it only consisted of these rules, it would be a semi-Thue system.)
To generate a string in the language, one begins with a string consisting of only a single start symbol, and then successively applies the rules (any number of times, in any order) to rewrite this string.
The language consists of all the strings that can be generated in this manner.
Any particular sequence of legal choices taken during this rewriting process yields one particular string in the language.
If there are multiple ways of generating the same single string, then the grammar is said to be ambiguous.
For example, assume the alphabet consists of <math/> and <math/>, the start symbol is <math/> and we have the following rules:
1. <math/>
2. <math/>
then we start with <math/>, and can choose a rule to apply to it.
If we choose rule 1, we obtain the string <math/>.
If we choose rule 1 again, we replace <math/> with <math/> and obtain the string <math/>.
This process can be repeated at will until all occurrences of S are removed, and only symbols from the alphabet remain (i.e., <math/> and <math/>).
For example, if we now choose rule 2, we replace <math/> with <math/> and obtain the string <math/>, and are done.
We can write this series of choices more briefly, using symbols: <math/>.
The language of the grammar is the set of all the strings that can be generated using this process: <math/>.
Formal definition
In the classic formalization of generative grammars first proposed by Noam Chomsky in the 1950s, a grammar G consists of the following components:
A finite set <math/> of nonterminal symbols.
A finite set <math/> of terminal symbols that is disjoint from <math/>.
A finite set <math/> of production rules, each of the form
<math/>
where <math/> is the Kleene star operator and <math/> denotes set union.
That is, each production rule maps from one string of symbols to another, where the first string contains at least one nonterminal symbol.
In the case that the second string is the empty string &ndash; that is, that it contains no symbols at all &ndash; in order to avoid confusion, the empty string is often denoted with a special notation, often (<math/>, <math/> or <math/>.
A distinguished symbol <math/> that is the start symbol.
A grammar is formally defined as the ordered quad-tuple <math/>.
Such a formal grammar is often called a rewriting system or a phrase structure grammar in the literature.
The operation of a grammar can be defined in terms of relations on strings:
Given a grammar <math/>, the binary relation <math/> (pronounced as "G derives in one step") on strings in <math/> is defined by:
<math/>
the relation <math/> (pronounced as G derives in zero or more steps) is defined as the transitive closure of <math/>
the language of <math/>, denoted as <math/>, is defined as all those strings over <math/> that can be generated by starting with the start symbol <math/> and then applying the production rules in <math/> until no more nonterminal symbols are present; that is, the set <math/>.
Note that the grammar <math/> is effectively the semi-Thue system <math/>, rewriting strings in exactly the same way; the only difference is in that we distinguish specific nonterminal symbols which must be rewritten in rewrite rules, and are only interested in rewritings from the designated start symbol <math/> to strings without nonterminal symbols.
Example
For these examples, formal languages are specified using set-builder notation.
Consider the grammar <math/> where <math/>, <math/>, <math/> is the start symbol, and <math/> consists of the following production rules:
1. <math/>
2. <math/>
3. <math/>
4. <math/>
Some examples of the derivation of strings in <math/> are:
<math/>
<math/>
<math/><math/>
(Note on notation: <math/> reads "L generates R by means of production i" and the generated part is each time indicated in bold.)
This grammar defines the language <math/> where <math/> denotes a string of n consecutive <math/>'s.
Thus, the language is the set of strings that consist of 1 or more <math/>'s, followed by the same number of <math/>'s, followed by the same number of <math/>'s.
The Chomsky hierarchy
When Noam Chomsky first formalized generative grammars in 1956, he classified them into types now known as the Chomsky hierarchy.
The difference between these types is that they have increasingly strict production rules and can express fewer formal languages.
Two important types are context-free grammars (Type 2) and regular grammars (Type 3).
The languages that can be described with such a grammar are called context-free languages and regular languages, respectively.
Although much less powerful than unrestricted grammars (Type 0), which can in fact express any language that can be accepted by a Turing machine, these two restricted types of grammars are most often used because parsers for them can be efficiently implemented.
For example, all regular languages can be recognized by a finite state machine, and for useful subsets of context-free grammars there are well-known algorithms to generate efficient LL parsers and LR parsers to recognize the corresponding languages those grammars generate.
Context-free grammars
A context-free grammar is a grammar in which the left-hand side of each production rule consists of only a single nonterminal symbol.
This restriction is non-trivial; not all languages can be generated by context-free grammars.
Those that can are called context-free languages.
The language defined above is not a context-free language, and this can be strictly proven using the pumping lemma for context-free languages, but for example the language <math/> (at least 1 <math/> followed by the same number of <math/>'s) is context-free, as it can be defined by the grammar <math/> with <math/>, <math/>, <math/> the start symbol, and the following production rules:
1. <math/>
2. <math/>
A context-free language can be recognized in <math/> time (see Big O notation) by an algorithm such as Earley's algorithm.
That is, for every context-free language, a machine can be built that takes a string as input and determines in <math/> time whether the string is a member of the language, where <math/> is the length of the string.
Further, some important subsets of the context-free languages can be recognized in linear time using other algorithms.
Regular grammars
In regular grammars, the left hand side is again only a single nonterminal symbol, but now the right-hand side is also restricted: It may be the empty string, or a single terminal symbol, or a single terminal symbol followed by a nonterminal symbol, but nothing else.
(Sometimes a broader definition is used: one can allow longer strings of terminals or single nonterminals without anything else, making languages easier to denote while still defining the same class of languages.)
The language defined above is not regular, but the language <math/> (at least 1 <math/> followed by at least 1 <math/>, where the numbers may be different) is, as it can be defined by the grammar <math/> with <math/>, <math/>, <math/> the start symbol, and the following production rules:
<math/>
<math/>
<math/>
<math/>
<math/>
All languages generated by a regular grammar can be recognized in linear time by a finite state machine.
Although, in practice, regular grammars are commonly expressed using regular expressions, some forms of regular expression used in practice do not strictly generate the regular languages and do not show linear recognitional performance due to those deviations.
Other forms of generative grammars
Many extensions and variations on Chomsky's original hierarchy of formal grammars have been developed more recently, both by linguists and by computer scientists, usually either in order to increase their expressive power or in order to make them easier to analyze or parse.
Some forms of grammars developed include:
Tree-adjoining grammars increase the expressiveness of conventional generative grammars by allowing rewrite rules to operate on parse trees instead of just strings.
Affix grammars and attribute grammars allow rewrite rules to be augmented with semantic attributes and operations, useful both for increasing grammar expressiveness and for constructing practical language translation tools.
Analytic grammars
Though there is very little literature on parsing algorithms, most of these algorithms assume that the language to be parsed is initially described by means of a generative formal grammar, and that the goal is to transform this generative grammar into a working parser.
Strictly speaking, a generative grammar does not in any way correspond to the algorithm used to parse a language, and various algorithms have different restrictions on the form of production rules that are considered well-formed.
An alternative approach is to formalize the language in terms of an analytic grammar in the first place, which more directly corresponds to the structure and semantics of a parser for the language.
Examples of analytic grammar formalisms include the following:
The Language Machine directly implements unrestricted analytic grammars.
Substitution rules are used to transform an input to produce outputs and behaviour.
The system can also produce the lm-diagram which shows what happens when the rules of an unrestricted analytic grammar are being applied.
Top-down parsing language (TDPL): a highly minimalist analytic grammar formalism developed in the early 1970s to study the behavior of top-down parsers.
Link grammars: a form of analytic grammar designed for linguistics, which derives syntactic structure by examining the positional relationships between pairs of words.
Parsing expression grammars (PEGs): a more recent generalization of TDPL designed around the practical expressiveness needs of programming language and compiler writers.
Free software
Free software or software libre is software that can be used, studied, and modified without restriction, and which can be copied and redistributed in modified or unmodified form either without restriction, or with minimal restrictions only to ensure that further recipients can also do these things.
In practice, for software to be distributed as free software, the human readable form of the program (the "source code") must be made available to the recipient along with a notice granting the above permissions.
Such a notice is a "free software licence", or, in theory, could be a notice saying that the source code is released into the public domain.
The free software movement was conceived in 1983 by Richard Stallman to make these freedoms available to every computer user.
From the late 1990s onward, alternative terms for free software came into use.
"Open source software" is the most common such alternative term.
Others include "software libre", "free, libre and open-source software" ("FOSS", or, with "libre", "FLOSS").
The antonym of free software is "proprietary software" or non-free software.
Free software is distinct from "freeware" which is proprietary software made available free of charge.
Users usually cannot study, modify, or redistribute freeware.
Since free software may be freely redistributed, it generally is available at little or no cost.
Free software business models are usually based on adding value such as support, training, customization, integration, or certification.
At the same time, some business models which work with proprietary software are not compatible with free software, such as those that depend on a user paying for a licence in order to lawfully use a software product.
History
In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, it was normal for computer users to have the freedoms that are provided by free software.
Software was commonly shared by individuals who used computers and by hardware manufacturers who were glad that people were making software that made their hardware useful.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, the software industry began using technical measures (such as only distributing binary copies of computer programs) to prevent computer users from being able to study and modify software..
In 1980 copyright law was extended to computer programs.
In 1983, Richard Stallman, longtime member of the hacker community at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, announced the GNU project, saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users.
Software development for the GNU operating system began in January 1984, and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) was founded in October 1985.
He developed a free software definition and the concept of "copyleft", designed to ensure software freedom for all.
Free software is a widespread international concept, producing software used by individuals, large organizations, and governmental administrations.
Free software has a very high market penetration in server-side Internet applications such as the Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP scripting language.
Completely free computing environments are available as large packages of basic system software, such as the many GNU/Linux distributions and FreeBSD.
Free software developers have also created free versions of almost all commonly used desktop applications, including Web browsers, office productivity suites, and multimedia players.
It is important to note, however, that in many categories, free software for individual workstations or home users has only a fraction of the market share of its proprietary competitors.
Most free software is distributed online without charge, or off-line at the marginal cost of distribution, but this pricing model is not required, and people may sell copies of free software programs for any price.
The economic viability of free software has been recognised by large corporations such as IBM, Red Hat, and Sun Microsystems.
Many companies whose core business is not in the IT sector choose free software for their Internet information and sales sites, due to the lower initial capital investment and ability to freely customize the application packages.
Also, some non-software industries are beginning to use techniques similar to those used in free software development for their research and development process; scientists, for example, are looking towards more open development processes, and hardware such as microchips are beginning to be developed with specifications released under copyleft licenses (see the OpenCores project, for instance).
Creative Commons and the free culture movement have also been largely influenced by the free software movement.
Naming
The FSF recommends using the term "free software" rather than "open source software" because that term and the associated marketing campaign focuses on the technical issues of software development, avoiding the issue of user freedoms.
"Libre" is used to avoid the ambiguity of the word "free".
However, amongst English speakers, libre is primarily only used within the free software movement.
Definition
The first formal definition of free software was published by FSF in February 1986.
That definition, written by Richard Stallman, is still maintained today and states that software is free software if people who receive a copy of the software have the following four freedoms:
Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
Freedom 1: The freedom to study and modify the program.
Freedom 2: The freedom to copy the program so you can help your neighbor.
Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.
Freedoms 1 and 3 require source code to be available because studying and modifying software without its source code is highly impractical.
Thus, free software means that computer users have the freedom to cooperate with whom they choose, and to control the software they use.
To summarize this into a remark distinguishing libre (freedom) software from gratis (zero price) software, Richard Stallman said: "Free software is a matter of liberty, not price.
To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech', not as in 'free beer<nowiki>'</nowiki>".
In the late 90s, other groups published their own definitions which describe an almost identical set of software.
The most notable are Debian Free Software Guidelines published in 1997, and the Open Source Definition, published in 1998.
The BSD-based operating systems, such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD, do not have their own formal definitions of free software.
Users of these systems generally find the same set of software to be acceptable, but sometimes see copyleft as restrictive.
They generally advocate permissive free software licenses, which allow others to make software based on their source code, and then release the modified result as proprietary software.
Their view is that this permissive approach is more free.
The Kerberos, X.org, and Apache software licenses are substantially similar in intent and implementation.
All of these software packages originated in academic institutions interested in wide technology transfer (University of California, MIT, and UIUC).

Free software licenses
All free software licenses must grant people all the freedoms discussed above.
However, unless the applications' licenses are compatible, combining programs by mixing source code or directly linking binaries is problematic, because of license technicalities.
Programs indirectly connected together may avoid this problem.
The majority of free software uses a small set of licenses.
The most popular of these licenses are:
the GNU General Public License
the GNU Lesser General Public License
the BSD License
the Mozilla Public License
the MIT License
the Apache License
The Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative both publish lists of licenses that they find to comply with their own definitions of free software and open-source software respectively.
List of FSF approved software licenses
List of OSI approved software licenses
These lists are necessarily incomplete, because a license need not be known by either organization in order to provide these freedoms.
Apart from these two organizations, the Debian project is seen by some to provide useful advice on whether particular licenses comply with their Debian Free Software Guidelines.
Debian doesn't publish a list of approved licenses, so its judgments have to be tracked by checking what software they have allowed into their software archives.
That is summarized at the Debian web site.
However, it is rare that a license is announced as being in-compliance by either FSF or OSI guidelines and not vice versa (the Netscape Public License used for early versions of Mozilla being an exception), so exact definitions of the terms have not become hot issues.
Permissive and copyleft licenses
The FSF categorizes licenses in the following ways:
Public domain software - the copyright has expired, the work was not copyrighted or the author has abandoned the copyright.
Since public-domain software lacks copyright protection, it may be freely incorporated into any work, whether proprietary or free.
Permissive licenses, also called BSD-style because they are applied to much of the software distributed with the BSD operating systems.
The author retains copyright solely to disclaim warranty and require proper attribution of modified works, but permits redistribution and modification in any work, even proprietary ones.
Copyleft licenses, the GNU General Public License being the most prominent.
The author retains copyright and permits redistribution and modification provided all such redistribution is licensed under the same license.
Additions and modifications by others must also be licensed under the same 'copyleft' license whenever they are distributed with part of the original licensed product.
Security and reliability
There is debate over the security of free software in comparison to proprietary software, with a major issue being security through obscurity.
A popular quantitative test in computer security is using relative counting of known unpatched security flaws.
Generally, users of this method advise avoiding products which lack fixes for known security flaws, at least until a fix is available.
Some claim that this method is biased by counting more vulnerabilities for the free software, since its source code is accessible and its community is more forthcoming about what problems exist.
Free software advocates rebut that even if proprietary software does not have "published" flaws, flaws could still exist and possibly be known to malicious users.
The ability of users to view and modify the source code allows many more people to potentially analyse the code and possibly to have a higher rate of finding bugs and flaws than an average sized corporation could manage.
Users having access to the source code also makes creating and deploying spyware far more difficult.
David A. Wheeler has published research concluding that free software is quantitatively more reliable than proprietary software.
Adoption
Free software played a part in the development of the Internet, the World Wide Web and the infrastructure of dot-com companies.
Free software allows users to cooperate in enhancing and refining the programs they use; free software is a pure public good rather than a private good.
Companies that contribute to free software can increase commercial innovation amidst the void of patent cross licensing lawsuits.
(See mpeg2 patent holders)
Under the free software business model, free software vendors may charge a fee for distribution and offer pay support and software customization services.
Proprietary software uses a different business model, where a customer of the proprietary software pays a fee for a license to use the software.
This license may grant the customer the ability to configure some or no parts of the software themselves.
Often some level of support is included in the purchase of proprietary software, but additional support services (especially for enterprise applications) are usually available for an additional fee.
Some proprietary software vendors will also customize software for a fee.
Free software is generally available at little to no cost and can result in permanently lower costs compared to proprietary software.
With free software, businesses can fit software to their specific needs by changing the software themselves or by hiring programmers to modify it for them.
Free software often has no warranty, and more importantly, generally does not assign legal liability to anyone.
However, warranties are permitted between any two parties upon the condition of the software and its usage.
Such an agreement is made separately from the free software license.
Controversies
Binary blobs
In 2006, OpenBSD started the first campaign against the use of binary blobs, in kernels.
Blobs are usually freely distributable device drivers for hardware from vendors that do not reveal driver source code to users or developers.
This restricts the users' freedom to effectively modify the software and distribute modified versions.
Also, since the blobs are undocumented and may have bugs, they pose a security risk to any operating system whose kernel includes them.
The proclaimed aim of the campaign against blobs is to collect hardware documentation that allows developers to write free software drivers for that hardware, ultimately enabling all free operating systems to become or remain blob-free.
The issue of binary blobs in the Linux kernel and other device drivers motivated some developers in Ireland to launch gNewSense, a GNU/Linux distribution with all the binary blobs removed.
The project received support from the Free Software Foundation
BitKeeper
Larry McVoy invited high-profile free software projects to use his proprietary versioning system, BitKeeper, free of charge, in order to attract paying users.
In 2002, Linux coordinator Linus Torvalds decided to use BitKeeper to develop the Linux kernel, a free software project, claiming no free software alternative met his needs.
This controversial decision drew criticism from several sources, including the Free Software Foundation's founder Richard Stallman.
Following the apparent reverse engineering of BitKeeper's protocols, McVoy withdrew permission for gratis use by free software projects, leading the Linux kernel community to develop a free software replacement in Git.
Patent deals
In November 2006, the Microsoft and Novell software corporations announced a controversial partnership involving, among other things, patent protection for some customers of Novell under certain conditions.
Freeware
Freeware is computer software that is available for use at no cost or for an optional fee.
Freeware is often made available in a binary-only, proprietary form, thus making it distinct from free software.
Proprietary freeware allows authors to contribute something for the benefit of the community, while at the same time allowing them to retain control of the source code and preserve its business potential.
Freeware is different from shareware, where the user is obliged to pay (e.g. after some trial period or for additional functionality).
History
The term freeware was coined by Andrew Fluegelman when he wanted to sell a communications program named PC-Talk that he had created but for which he did not wish to use traditional methods of distribution because of their cost.
Fluegelman actually distributed PC-Talk via a process now referred to as shareware.
Current use of the term freeware does not necessarily match the original concept by Andrew Fluegelman.
Criteria
The only criterion for being classified as freeware is that the software must be fully functional for an unlimited time with no monetary cost.
The software license may impose one or more other restrictions on the type of use including personal use, individual use, non-profit use, non-commercial use, academic use, commercial use or any combination of these.
For instance, the license may be "free for personal, non-commercial use."
Everything created with the freeware programs can be distributed at no cost (for example graphic, documents, or sounds made by user).
French language
French (français, ) is today spoken around the world by 72 to 130 million people as a native language, and by about 190 to 600 million people as a second or third language, with significant speakers in 54 countries.
Most native speakers of the language live in France, where the language originated.
The rest live in Canada, Belgium and Switzerland.
French is a descendant of the Latin language of the Roman Empire, as are languages such as Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Catalan and Romanian.
Its development was also influenced by the native Celtic languages of Roman Gaul and by the Germanic language of the post-Roman Frankish invaders.
It is an official language in 29 countries, most of which form what is called in French La Francophonie, the community of French-speaking nations.
It is an official language of all United Nations agencies and a large number of international organizations.
According to the European Union, 129 million (26% of the 497,198,740) people in 27 member states speak French, of which 59 million (12%) speak it natively and 69 million (14%) claim to speak it as a second language, which makes it the third most spoken second language in the Union, after English and German respectively.

Legal status in France
Per the Constitution of France, French has been the official language since 1992 (although previous legal texts have made it official since 1539, see ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts).
France mandates the use of French in official government publications, public education outside of specific cases (though these dispositions are often ignored) and legal contracts; advertisements must bear a translation of foreign words.
In addition to French, there are also a variety of regional languages.
France has signed the European Charter for Regional Languages but has not ratified it since that would go against the 1958 Constitution.
Switzerland
French is one of the four official languages of Switzerland (along with German, Italian, and Romansh) and is spoken in the part of Switzerland called Romandie.
French is the native language of about 20% of the Swiss population.
Belgium
In Belgium, French is the official language of Wallonia (excluding the East Cantons, which are German-speaking) and one of the two official languages—along with Dutch—of the Brussels-Capital Region where it is spoken by the majority of the population, though often not as their primary language.
French and German are not official languages nor recognised minority languages in the Flemish Region, although along borders with the Walloon and Brussels-Capital regions, there are a dozen of municipalities with language facilities for French-speakers; a mirroring situation exists for the Walloon Region with respect to the Dutch and German languages.
In total, native French-speakers make up about 40% of the country's population, the remaining 60% speak Dutch, the latter of which 59% claim to speak French as a second language.
French is thus known by an estimated 75% of all Belgians, either as a mother tongue, as second, or as third language.
Monaco and Andorra
Although Monégasque is the national language of the Principality of Monaco, French is the only official language, and French nationals make up some 47% of the population.
Catalan is the only official language of Andorra; however, French is commonly used due to the proximity to France.
French nationals make up 7% of the population.
Italy
French is also an official language, along with Italian, in the province of Aosta Valley, Italy.
In addition, a number of Franco-Provençal dialects are spoken in the province, although they do not have official recognition.
Luxembourg
French is one of three official languages of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg  ;
the other official languages of Luxembourg are
German
Luxemburgish.
Luxemburgish is the natively-spoken language of Luxembourg ;
Luxembourg's education system is trilingual: the first years of primary school are in Luxembourgish, before changing to German, while secondary school, the language of instruction changes to French.
The Channel Islands
Although Jersey and Guernsey, the two bailiwicks collectively referred to as the Channel Islands, are separate entities, both use French to some degree, mostly in an administrative capacity.
Jersey Legal French is the standardized variety used in Jersey.
The Americas
Legal status in Canada
About 7 million Canadians are native French-speakers, of whom 6 million live in Quebec, and French is one of Canada's two official languages (the other being English).
Various provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms deal with Canadians' right to access services in both languages, including the right to a publicly funded education in the minority language of each province, where numbers warrant in a given locality.
By law, the federal government must operate and provide services in both English and French, proceedings of the Parliament of Canada must be translated into both these languages, and most products sold in Canada must have labeling in both languages.
Overall, about 13% of Canadians have knowledge of French only, while 18% have knowledge of both English and French.
In contrast, over 82% of the population of Quebec speaks French natively, and almost 96% speak it as either their first or second language.
It has been the sole official language of Quebec since 1974.
The legal status of French was further strengthened with the 1977 adoption of the Charter of the French Language (popularly known as Bill 101), which guarantees that every person has a right to have the civil administration, the health and social services, corporations, and enterprises in Quebec communicate with him in French.
While the Charter mandates that certain provincial government services, such as those relating to health and education, be offered to the English minority in its language, where numbers warrant, its primary purpose is to cement the role of French as the primary language used in the public sphere.
[[Image:Knowledge French EU map.png|right|thumb|240px|Knowledge of French in the European Union and candidate countries]] The provision of the Charter that has arguably had the most significant impact mandates French-language education unless a child's parents or siblings have received the majority of their own primary education in English within Canada, with minor exceptions.
This measure has reversed a historical trend whereby a large number of immigrant children would attend English schools.
In so doing, the Charter has greatly contributed to the "visage français" (French face) of Montreal in spite of its growing immigrant population.
Other provisions of the Charter have been ruled unconstitutional over the years, including those mandating French-only commercial signs, court proceedings, and debates in the legislature.
Though none of these provisions are still in effect today, some continued to be on the books for a time even after courts had ruled them unconstitutional as a result of the government's decision to invoke the so-called notwithstanding clause of the Canadian constitution to override constitutional requirements.
In 1993, the Charter was rewritten to allow signage in other languages so long as French was markedly "predominant."
Another section of the Charter guarantees every person the right to work in French, meaning the right to have all communications with one's superiors and coworkers in French, as well as the right not to be required to know another language as a condition of hiring, unless this is warranted by the nature of one's duties, such as by reason of extensive interaction with people located outside the province or similar reasons.
This section has not been as effective as had originally been hoped, and has faded somewhat from public consciousness.
As of 2006, approximately 65% of the workforce on the island of Montreal predominantly used French in the workplace.
The only other province that recognizes French as an official language is New Brunswick, which is officially bilingual, like the nation as a whole.
Outside of Quebec, the highest number of Francophones in Canada, 485,000, excluding those who claim multiple mother tongues, reside in Ontario, whereas New Brunswick, home to the vast majority of Acadians, has the highest percentage of Francophones after Quebec, 33%, or 237,000.
In Ontario, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Manitoba, French does not have full official status, although the provincial governments do provide some French-language services in all communities where significant numbers of Francophones live.
Canada's three northern territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut) all recognize French as an official language as well.
All provinces make some effort to accommodate the needs of their Francophone citizens, although the level and quality of French-language service vary significantly from province to province.
The Ontario French Language Services Act, adopted in 1986, guarantees French language services in that province in regions where the Francophone population exceeds 10% of the total population, as well as communities with Francophone populations exceeding 5,000, and certain other designated areas; this has the most effect in the north and east of the province, as well as in other larger centres such as Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton, Mississauga, London, Kitchener, St. Catharines, Greater Sudbury and Windsor.
However, the French Language Services Act does not confer the status of "official bilingualism" on these cities, as that designation carries with it implications which go beyond the provision of services in both languages.
The City of Ottawa's language policy (by-law 2001-170) allows employees to work in their official language of choice and be supervised in the language of choice.
Canada has the status of member state in the Francophonie, while the provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick are recognized as participating governments.
Ontario is currently seeking to become a full member on its own.
Haiti
French is an official language of Haiti, although it is mostly spoken by the upper class, while Haitian Creole (a French-based creole language) is more widely spoken as a mother tongue.
French overseas territories
French is also the official language in France's overseas territories of French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Barthélemy, St. Martin and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.
The United States
Although it has no official recognition on a federal level, French is the third most-spoken language in the United States, after English and Spanish, and the second most-spoken in the states of Louisiana, Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire.
Louisiana is home to two distinct dialects, Cajun French and Creole French
Africa
A majority of the world's French-speaking population lives in Africa.
According to the 2007 report by the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, an estimated 115 million African people spread across 31 francophone African countries can speak French either as a first or second language.
French is mostly a second language in Africa, but in some areas it has become a first language, such as in the region of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire and in Libreville, Gabon.
It is impossible to speak of a single form of African French, but rather of diverse forms of African French which have developed due to the contact with many indigenous African languages.
In the territories of the Indian Ocean, the French language is often spoken alongside French-derived creole languages, the major exception being Madagascar.
There, a Malayo-Polynesian language (Malagasy) is spoken alongside French.
The French language has also met competition with English since English has been the official language in Mauritius and the Seychelles for a long time and has recently become an official language of Madagascar.
Sub-Saharan Africa is the region where the French language is most likely to expand due to the expansion of education and it is also there the language has evolved most in recent years.
Some vernacular forms of French in Africa can be difficult to understand for French speakers from other countries but written forms of the language are very closely related to those of the rest of the French-speaking world.
French is an official language of many African countries, most of them former French or Belgian colonies:
Benin
Burkina Faso
Burundi
Cameroon
Central African Republic
Chad
Comoros
Congo (Brazzaville)
Côte d'Ivoire
Democratic Republic of the Congo
Djibouti
Equatorial Guinea (former colony of Spain)
Gabon
Guinea
Madagascar
Mali
Niger
Rwanda
Senegal
Seychelles
Togo
In addition, French is an administrative language and commonly used though not on an official basis in Mauritius and in the Maghreb states:
Mauritania
Algeria
Morocco
Tunisia.
Various reforms have been implemented in recent decades in Algeria to improve the status of Arabic relative to French, especially in education.
While the predominant European language in Egypt is English, French is considered to be a more sophisticated language by some elements of the Egyptian upper and upper-middle classes; for this reason, a typical educated Egyptian will learn French in addition to English at some point in his or her education.
The perception of sophistication may be related to the use of French as the royal court language of Egypt during the nineteenth century.
Egypt participates in La Francophonie.
French is also the official language of Mayotte and Réunion, two overseas territories of France located in the Indian Ocean, as well as an administrative and educational language in Mauritius, along with English.
Asia
Lebanon
French was the official language in Lebanon along with Arabic until 1941, the country's declaration of independence from France.
French is still seen as an official language by the Lebanese people as it is widely used by the Lebanese, especially for administrative purposes, and is taught in schools as a primary language along with Arabic.
Southeast Asia
French is an administrative language in Laos and Cambodia.
French was historically spoken by the elite in the leased territory Guangzhouwan in southern China.
In colonial Vietnam, the elites spoke French and many who worked for the French spoke a French creole known as "Tây Bồi" (now extinct).
India
French has official status in the Indian Union Territory of Pondicherry, along with the regional language Tamil and some students of Tamil Nadu may opt French as their third or fourth language (usually behind English, Tamil, Hindi).
French is also commonly taught as third language in secondary school in most cities of Maharashtra State including Mumbai as part of the Secondary (X-SSC) and Higher secondary School (XII-HSC) certificate examinations.
Oceania
French is also a second official language of the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, along with France's territories of French Polynesia, Wallis & Futuna and New Caledonia.

History
Sounds
<ipa/>
Although there are many French regional accents, only one version of the language is normally chosen as a model for foreign learners, which has no commonly used special name, but has been termed français neutre (neutral French).
Voiced stops (i.e. <ipa/>) are typically produced fully voiced throughout.
Voiceless stops (i.e. <ipa/>) are unaspirated.
Nasals: The velar nasal <ipa/> occurs only in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: parking, camping, swing.
The palatal nasal <ipa/>can occur in word initial position (e.g. gnon), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g. montagne).
Fricatives: French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e. labiodental <ipa/>, dental <ipa/>, and palato-alveolar <ipa/>.
Notice that <ipa/> are dental, like the plosives <ipa/>, and the nasal <ipa/>.
French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts.
In general it is described as a voiced uvular fricative as in <ipa/> roue "wheel" .
Vowels are often lengthened before this segment.
It can be reduced to an approximant, particularly in final position (e.g. "fort") or reduced to zero in some word-final positions.
For other speakers, a uvular trill is also fairly common, and an apical trill <ipa/> occurs in some dialects.
Lateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant <ipa/> is unvelarised in both onset (lire) and coda position (il).
In the onset, the central approximants <ipa/>, <ipa/>, and <ipa/> each correspond to a high vowel, <ipa/>, <ipa/>, and <ipa/> respectively.
There are a few minimal pairs where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation.
Contrasts between <ipa/> and <ipa/> occur in final position as in <ipa/> paye "pay" vs. <ipa/> pays "country".
French pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology.
The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:
final consonants: Final single consonants, in particular s, x, z, t, d, n and m, are normally silent.
(The final letters c, r, f and l, however, are normally pronounced.)
When the following word begins with a vowel, though, a silent consonant may once again be pronounced, to provide a liaison or "link" between the two words.
Some liaisons are mandatory, for example the s in les amants or vous avez; some are optional, depending on dialect and register, for example the first s in deux cents euros or euros irlandais; and some are forbidden, for example the s in beaucoup d'hommes aiment.
The t of et is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in set phrases like pied-à-terre.
Note that in the case of a word ending d as in pied-à-terre, the consonant t is pronounced instead.
Doubling a final n and adding a silent e at the end of a word (e.g. chien → chienne) makes it clearly pronounced.
Doubling a final l and adding a silent e (e.g. gentil → gentille) adds a [j] sound.
elision or vowel dropping: Some monosyllabic function words ending in a or e, such as je and que, drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a hiatus).
The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g. je ai is instead pronounced and spelt → j'ai).
This gives for example the same pronunciation for l'homme qu'il a vu ("the man whom he saw") and l'homme qui l'a vu ("the man who saw him").
Orthography
Nasal: n and m.
When n or m follows a vowel or diphthong, the n or m becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e. pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils).
Exceptions are when the n or m is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel.
The prefixes en- and em- are always nasalized.
The rules get more complex than this but may vary between dialects.
Digraphs: French does not introduce extra letters or diacritics to specify its large range of vowel sounds and diphthongs, rather it uses specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.
Gemination: Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur).
For example, illusion is pronounced <ipa/> and not <ipa/>.
But gemination does occur between words.
For example, une info ("a news") is pronounced <ipa/>, whereas une nympho ("a nympho") is pronounced <ipa/>.
Accents are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes for etymology alone.
Accents that affect pronunciation
The acute accent (l'accent aigu), é (e.g. école—school), means that the vowel is pronounced <ipa/> instead of the default <ipa/>.
The grave accent (l'accent grave), è (e.g. élève—pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced <ipa/> instead of the default <ipa/>.
The circumflex (l'accent circonflexe) ê (e.g. forêt—forest) shows that an e is pronounced <ipa/> and that an o is pronounced <ipa/>.
In standard French it also signifies a pronunciation of <ipa/> for the letter a, but this differentiation is disappearing.
In the late 19th century, the circumflex was used in place of s where that letter was not to be pronounced.
Thus, forest became forêt and hospital became hôpital.
The diaeresis (le tréma) (e.g. naïf—foolish, Noël—Christmas) as in English, specifies that this vowel is pronounced separately from the preceding one, not combined and is not a schwa.
The cedilla (la cédille) ç (e.g. garçon—boy) means that the letter c is pronounced <ipa/> in front of the hard vowels a, o and u (c is otherwise <ipa/> before a hard vowel).
C is always pronounced <ipa/> in front of the soft vowels e, i, and y, thus ç is never found in front of soft vowels.
Accents with no pronunciation effect
The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters i or u, and in most dialects, a as well.
It usually indicates that an s came after it long ago, as in hôtel.
All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs là and où ("there", "where") from the article la and the conjunction ou ("the" fem. sing., "or") respectively.
Grammar
French grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including:
the loss of Latin's declensions
only two grammatical genders
the development of grammatical articles from Latin demonstratives
new tenses formed from auxiliaries
French word order is Subject Verb Object, except when the object is a pronoun, in which case the word order is Subject Object Verb.
Some rare archaisms allow for different word orders.
Vocabulary
The majority of French words derive from Vulgar Latin or were constructed from Latin or Greek roots.
There are often pairs of words, one form being "popular" (noun) and the other one "savant" (adjective), both originating from Latin.
Example:
brother: frère / fraternel < from Latin frater
finger: doigt / digital < from Latin digitus
faith: foi / fidèle < from Latin fides
cold: froid / frigide < from Latin frigidus
eye: œil / oculaire < from Latin oculus
In some examples there is a common word from Vulgar Latin and a more savant word borrowed directly from Medieval Latin or even Ancient Greek.
Cheval—Concours équestre—Hippodrome
The French words which have developed from Latin are usually less recognisable than Italian words of Latin origin because as French evolved from Vulgar Latin, the unstressed final syllable of many words was dropped or elided into the following word.
It is estimated that 12% (4,200) of common French words found in a typical dictionary such as the Petit Larousse or Micro-Robert Plus (35,000 words) are of foreign origin.
About 25% (1,054) of these foreign words come from English and are fairly recent borrowings.
The others are some 707 words from Italian, 550 from ancient Germanic languages, 481 from ancient Gallo-Romance languages, 215 from Arabic, 164 from German, 160 from Celtic languages, 159 from Spanish, 153 from Dutch, 112 from Persian and Sanskrit, 101 from Native American languages, 89 from other Asian languages, 56 from other Afro-Asiatic languages, 55 from Slavic languages and Baltic languages, 10 for Basque and 144 — about three percent — from other languages.
Numerals
The French counting system is partially vigesimal: twenty (<foreign/>) is used as a base number in the names of numbers from 60–99.
The French word for eighty, for example, is <foreign/>, which literally means "four twenties", and <foreign/> (literally "sixty-fifteen") means 75.
This reform arose after the French Revolution to unify the different counting system (mostly vigesimal near the coast, due to Celtic (via Basque) and Viking influence).
This system is comparable to the archaic English use of score, as in "fourscore and seven" (87), or "threescore and ten" (70).
Belgian French and Swiss French are different in this respect.
In Belgium and Switzerland 70 and 90 are <foreign/> and <foreign/>.
In Switzerland, depending on the local dialect, 80 can be <foreign/> (Geneva, Neuchâtel, Jura) or <foreign/> (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg).
Octante had been used in Switzerland in the past, but is now considered archaic.
In Belgium, however, quatre-vingts is universally used.
Writing system
French is written using the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, plus five diacritics (the circumflex accent, acute accent, grave accent, diaeresis, and cedilla) and the two ligatures (œ) and (æ).
French spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules.
This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling.
Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography:
Old French doit > French doigt "finger" (Latin digitus)
Old French pie > French pied "foot" (Latin pes (stem: ped-)
As a result, it is difficult to predict the spelling on the basis of the sound alone.
Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel.
For example, all of these words end in a vowel sound: pied, aller, les, finit, beaux.
The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: beaux-arts, les amis, pied-à-terre.
On the other hand, a given spelling will almost always lead to a predictable sound, and the Académie française works hard to enforce and update this correspondence.
In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic predictably leads to one phoneme.
The diacritics have phonetic, semantic, and etymological significance.
acute accent (é): Over an e, indicates the sound of a short ai in English, with no diphthong.
An é in modern French is often used where a combination of e and a consonant, usually s, would have been used formerly: écouter < escouter.
This type of accent mark is called accent aigu in French.
grave accent (à, è, ù): Over a or u, used only to distinguish homophones: à ("to") vs. a ("has"), ou ("or") vs. où ("where").
Over an e, indicates the sound <ipa/>.
circumflex (â, ê, î, ô, û): Over an a, e or o, indicates the sound <ipa/>, <ipa/> or <ipa/>, respectively (the distinction a <ipa/> vs. â <ipa/> tends to disappear in many dialects).
Most often indicates the historical deletion of an adjacent letter (usually an s or a vowel): château < castel, fête < feste, sûr < seur, dîner < disner.
It has also come to be used to distinguish homophones: du ("of the") vs. dû (past participle of devoir "to have to do something (pertaining to an act)"; note that dû is in fact written thus because of a dropped e: deu).
(See Use of the circumflex in French)
diaeresis or tréma (ë, ï, ü, ÿ): Indicates that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding one: naïve, Noël.
A diaeresis on y only occurs in some proper names and in modern editions of old French texts.
Some proper names in which ÿ appears include Aÿ (commune in canton de la Marne formerly Aÿ-Champagne), Rue des Cloÿs (alley in the 18th arrondisement of Paris), Croÿ (family name and hotel on the Boulevard Raspail, Paris), Château du Feÿ (near Joigny), Ghÿs (name of Flemish origin spelt Ghĳs where ĳ in handwriting looked like ÿ to French clerks), l'Haÿ-les-Roses (commune between Paris and Orly airport), Pierre Louÿs (author), Moÿ (place in commune de l'Aisne and family name), and Le Blanc de Nicolaÿ (an insurance company in eastern France).
The diaresis on u appears only in the biblical proper names Archélaüs, Capharnaüm, Emmaüs, Ésaü and Saül.
Nevertheless, since the 1990 orthographic rectifications (which are not applied at all by most French people), the diaeresis in words containing guë (such as aiguë or ciguë) may be moved onto the u: aigüe, cigüe.
Words coming from German retain the old Umlaut (ä, ö and ü) if applicable but use French pronunciation, such as kärcher (trade mark of a pressure washer).
cedilla (ç): Indicates that an etymological c is pronounced <ipa/> when it would otherwise be pronounced /k/.
Thus je lance "I throw" (with c = <ipa/> before e), je lançais "I was throwing" (c would be pronounced <ipa/> before a without the cedilla).
The c cedilla (ç) softens the hard /k/ sound to /s/ before the vowels a, o or u, for example ça /sa/.
C cedilla is never used before the vowels e or i since these two vowels always produce a soft /s/ sound (ce, ci).
There are two ligatures, which have various origins.
The ligature œ is a mandatory contraction of oe in certain words.
Some of these are native French words, with the pronunciation <ipa/> or <ipa/>, e.g. sœur "sister" <ipa/>, œuvre "work (of art)" <ipa/>.
Note that it usually appears in the combination œu; œil is an exception.
Many of these words were originally written with the digraph eu; the o in the ligature represents a sometimes artificial attempt to imitate the Latin spelling: Latin bovem > Old French buef/beuf > Modern French bœuf. Œ is also used in words of Greek origin, as the Latin rendering of the Greek diphthong οι, e.g. cœlacanthe "coelacanth".
These words used to be pronounced with the vowel <ipa/>, but in recent years a spelling pronunciation with <ipa/> has taken hold, e.g. œsophage <ipa/> or <ipa/>.
The pronunciation with <ipa/> is often seen to be more correct.
The ligature œ is not used in some occurrences of the letter combination oe, for example, when o is part of a prefix (coexister).
The ligature æ is rare and appears in some words of Latin and Greek origin like ægosome, ægyrine, æschne, cæcum, nævus or uræus.
The vowel quality is identical to é <ipa/>.
French writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language.
In Old French, the plural for animal was animals.
Common speakers pronounced a u before a word ending in l as the plural.
This resulted in animauls.
As the French language evolved this vanished and the form animaux (aux pronounced <ipa/>) was admitted.
The same is true for cheval pluralized as chevaux and many others.
Also castel pl. castels became château pl. châteaux.
Samples
German language
The German language (<foreign/>) is a West Germanic language and one of the world's major languages.
German is closely related to and classified alongside English and Dutch.
Around the world, German is spoken by approximately 100 million native speakers and also about 80 million non-native speakers, and Standard German is widely taught in schools, universities, and Goethe Institutes worldwide.
Geographic distribution
Europe
German is spoken primarily in Germany (95%), Austria (89%) and Switzerland (64%) together with Liechtenstein, Luxembourg (D-A-CH-Li-Lux) constituting the countries where German is the majority language.
Other European German-speaking communities are found in Italy (Bolzano-Bozen), in the East Cantons of Belgium, in the french area Alsace which often was traded between Germany and France in history and in some border villages of the former South Jutland County (in German, Nordschleswig, in Danish, Sønderjylland) of Denmark.
Some German-speaking communities still survive in parts of Romania, the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, and above all Russia and Kazakhstan, although forced expulsions after World War II and massive emigration to Germany in the 1980s and 1990s have depopulated most of these communities.
It is also spoken by German-speaking foreign populations and some of their descendants in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Morocco, Egypt, Israel, Cyprus, Turkey, Greece, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Scandinavia, Siberia in Russia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Croatia and Slovenia).
In Luxembourg and the surrounding areas, big parts of the native population speak German dialects, and some people also master standard German (especially in Luxembourg), although in the French regions of Alsace (German: Elsass) and Lorraine (German: Lothringen) French has replaced the local German dialects as the official language, even though it has not been fully replaced on the street.
Overseas
Outside of Europe and the former Soviet Union, the largest German-speaking communities are to be found in the United States, Canada, Brazil and in Argentina where millions of Germans migrated in the last 200 years; but the vast majority of their descendants no longer speak German.
Additionally, German-speaking communities can be found in the former German colony of Namibia independent from South Africa since 1990, as well as in the other countries of German emigration such as Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, Venezuela (where Alemán Coloniero developed), South Africa and Australia.
South America
In Brazil the largest concentrations of German speakers are in Rio Grande do Sul (where Riograndenser Hunsrückisch was developed), Santa Catarina, Paraná, and Espírito Santo, and large German-speaking descendant communities in Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.
In the 20th century, over 100,000 German political refugees and invited entrepreneurs settled in Latin America, such as Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic to establish German-speaking enclaves, and there is a reportedly small German immigration to Puerto Rico.
North America
The United States has the largest concentration of German speakers outside of Europe; an indication of this presence can be found in the names of such villages and towns as New Leipzig, Munich, Karlsruhe, and Strasburg, North Dakota, and New Braunfels, Texas.
Though over the course of the 20th century many of the descendants of 18th and 19th-century immigrants ceased speaking German at home, small populations of elderly (as well as some younger) speakers can be found in Pennsylvania (Amish, Hutterites, Dunkards and some Mennonites historically spoke Pennsylvania Dutch (a West Central German variety) and Hutterite German), Kansas (Mennonites and Volga Germans), North Dakota (Hutterite Germans, Mennonites, Russian Germans, Volga Germans, and Baltic Germans), South Dakota, Montana, Texas (Texas German), Wisconsin, Indiana, Louisiana and Oklahoma.
Early twentieth century immigration was often to St. Louis, Chicago, New York, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati.
Most of the post–World War II wave are in the New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago urban areas, and in Florida, Arizona and California where large communities of retired German, Swiss and Austrian expatriates live.
The American population of German ancestry is above 60 million.
The German language is the third largest language in the U.S. after Spanish.
In Canada there are people of German ancestry throughout the country and especially in the western cities such as Kelowna.
German is also spoken in Ontario and southern Nova Scotia.
There is a large and vibrant community in the city of Kitchener, Ontario.
German immigrants were instrumental in the country's three largest urban areas: Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, but post-WWII immigrants managed to preserve a fluency in the German language in their respective neighborhoods and sections.
In the first half of the 20th century, over a million German-Canadians made the language one of Canada's most spoken after French.
In Mexico there are also large populations of German ancestry, mainly in the cities of: Mexico City, Puebla, Mazatlán, Tapachula, and larger populations scattered in the states of Chihuahua, Durango, and Zacatecas.
German ancestry is also said to be found in neighboring towns around Guadalajara, Jalisco and much of Northern Mexico, where German influence was immersed into the Mexican culture.
Standard German is spoken by the affluent German communities in Puebla, Mexico City, Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi and Quintana Roo.
German immigration in the twentieth century was small, but produced German-speaking communities in Central America (i.e.
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua) and the Caribbean Islands like the Dominican Republic.
Dialects in North America:
The dialects of German which are or were primarily spoken in colonies or communities founded by German speaking people resemble the dialects of the regions the founders came from.
For example, Pennsylvania German resembles dialects of the Palatinate, and Hutterite German resembles dialects of Carinthia.
Texas German is a dialect spoken in the areas of Texas settled by the Adelsverein, such as New Braunfels and Fredericksburg.
In the Amana Colonies in the state of Iowa Amana German is spoken.
Plautdietsch is a large minority language spoken in Northern Mexico by the Mennonite communities, and is spoken by more than 200,000 people in Mexico.
Hutterite German is an Upper German dialect of the Austro-Bavarian variety of the German language, which is spoken by Hutterite communities in Canada and the United States.
Hutterite is spoken in the U.S. states of Washington, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, and Minnesota; and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
Its speakers belong to some Schmiedleit, Lehrerleit, and Dariusleit Hutterite groups, but there are also speakers among the older generations of Prairieleit (the descendants of those Hutterites who chose not to settle in colonies).
Hutterite children who grow up in the colonies learn and speak first Hutterite German before learning English in the public school, the standard language of the surrounding areas.
Many colonies though continue with German Grammar School, separate from the public school, throughout a student's elementary education.
Creoles
There is an important German creole being studied and recovered, named Unserdeutsch, spoken in the former German colony of Papua New Guinea, across Micronesia and in northern Australia (i.e. coastal parts of Queensland and Western Australia), by few elderly people.
The risk of its extinction is serious and efforts to revive interest in the language are being implemented by scholars.

According to Global Reach (2004), 6.9% of the Internet population is German.
According to Netz-tipp (2002), 7.7% of webpages are written in German, making it second only to English in the European language group.
They also report that 12% of Google's users use its German interface.
Older statistics: Babel (1998) found somewhat similar demographics.
FUNREDES (1998) and Vilaweb (2000) both found that German is the third most popular language used by websites, after English and Japanese.
History
The history of the language begins with the High German consonant shift during the migration period, separating High German dialects from common West Germanic.
The earliest testimonies of Old High German are from scattered Elder Futhark inscriptions, especially in Alemannic, from the 6th century, the earliest glosses (Abrogans) date to the 8th and the oldest coherent texts (the Hildebrandslied, the Muspilli and the Merseburg Incantations) to the 9th century.
Old Saxon at this time belongs to the North Sea Germanic cultural sphere, and Low Saxon should fall under German rather than Anglo-Frisian influence during the Holy Roman Empire.
As Germany was divided into many different states, the only force working for a unification or standardization of German during a period of several hundred years was the general preference of writers trying to write in a way that could be understood in the largest possible area.
When Martin Luther translated the Bible (the New Testament in 1522 and the Old Testament, published in parts and completed in 1534) he based his translation mainly on the bureaucratic standard language used in Saxony (sächsische Kanzleisprache) also known as Meißner-Deutsch (Meißner-German), which was the most widely understood language at this time, because the region it was spoken in was quite influential amongst the German states.
This language was based on Eastern Upper and Eastern Central German dialects and preserved much of the grammatical system of Middle High German (unlike the spoken German dialects in Central and Upper Germany that already at that time began to lose the genitive case and the preterite tense).
In the beginning, copies of the Bible had a long list for each region, which translated words unknown in the region into the regional dialect.
Roman Catholics rejected Luther's translation in the beginning and tried to create their own Catholic standard (gemeines Deutsch) — which, however, only differed from 'Protestant German' in some minor details.
It took until the middle of the 18th century to create a standard that was widely accepted, thus ending the period of Early New High German.
In 1901 the 2nd Orthographical Conference ended with a complete standardization of German language in written form while the Deutsche Bühnensprache (literally: German stage-language) had already established spelling-rules for German three years earlier which were later to become obligatory for general German pronunciation.
German used to be the language of commerce and government in the Habsburg Empire, which encompassed a large area of Central and Eastern Europe.
Until the mid-19th century it was essentially the language of townspeople throughout most of the Empire.
It indicated that the speaker was a merchant, an urbanite, not their nationality.
Some cities, such as Prague (German: Prag) and Budapest (Buda, German: Ofen), were gradually Germanized in the years after their incorporation into the Habsburg domain.
Others, such as Bratislava(German: Pressburg), were originally settled during the Habsburg period and were primarily German at that time.
A few cities such as Milan (German: Mailand) remained primarily non-German.
However, most cities were primarily German during this time, such as Prague, Budapest, Bratislava (German: Pressburg), Zagreb (German: Agram), and Ljubljana (German: Laibach), though they were surrounded by territory that spoke other languages.
Until about 1800, standard German was almost only a written language.
At this time, people in urban northern Germany, who spoke dialects very different from Standard German, learned it almost like a foreign language and tried to pronounce it as close to the spelling as possible.
Prescriptive pronunciation guides used to consider northern German pronunciation to be the standard.
However, the actual pronunciation of standard German varies from region to region.
Media and written works are almost all produced in standard German (often called Hochdeutsch in German) which is understood in all areas where German is spoken, except by pre-school children in areas which speak only dialect, for example Switzerland and Austria.
However, in this age of television, even they now usually learn to understand Standard German before school age.
The first dictionary of the Brothers Grimm, the 16 parts of which were issued between 1852 and 1860, remains the most comprehensive guide to the words of the German language.
In 1860, grammatical and orthographic rules first appeared in the Duden Handbook.
In 1901, this was declared the standard definition of the German language.
Official revisions of some of these rules were not issued until 1998, when the German spelling reform of 1996 was officially promulgated by governmental representatives of all German-speaking countries.
Since the reform, German spelling has been in an eight-year transitional period where the reformed spelling is taught in most schools, while traditional and reformed spellings co-exist in the media.
See German spelling reform of 1996 for an overview of the public debate concerning the reform with some major newspapers and magazines and several known writers refusing to adopt it.
The German spelling reform of 1996 led to public controversy indeed to considerable dispute.
Some state parliaments (Bundesländer) would not accept it (North Rhine Westphalia and Bavaria).
The dispute landed at one point in the highest court which made a short issue of it, claiming that the states had to decide for themselves and that only in schools could the reform be made the official rule - everybody else could continue writing as they had learned it.
After 10 years, without any intervention by the federal parliament, a major yet incomplete revision was installed in 2006, just in time for the new school year of 2006.
In 2007, some venerable spellings will be finally invalidated even though they caused little or no trouble.
The only sure and easily recognizable symptom of a text's being in compliance with the reform is the -ss at the end of words, like in dass and muss.
Classic spelling forbade this ending, instead using daß and muß.
The cause of the controversy evolved around the question whether a language is part of the culture which must be preserved or a means of communicating information which has to allow for growth.
(The reformers seemed to be unimpressed by the fact that a considerable part of that culture - namely the entire German literature of the 20th century - is in the old spelling.)
The increasing use of English in Germany's higher education system, as well as in business and in popular culture, has led various German academics to state, not necessarily from an entirely negative perspective, that German is a language in decline in its native country.
For example, Ursula Kimpel, of the University of Tübingen, said in 2005 that “German universities are offering more courses in English because of the large number of students coming from abroad.
German is unfortunately a language in decline.
We need and want our professors to be able to teach effectively in English.”
Standard German
Standard German originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region, but as a written language.
However, there are places where the traditional regional dialects have been replaced by standard German; this is the case in vast stretches of Northern Germany, but also in major cities in other parts of the country.
Standard German differs regionally, between German-speaking countries, in vocabulary and some instances of pronunciation, and even grammar and orthography.
This variation must not be confused with the variation of local dialects.
Even though the regional varieties of standard German are only to a certain degree influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct.
German is thus considered a pluricentric language.
In most regions, the speakers use a continuum of mixtures from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties according to situation.
In the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, mixtures of dialect and standard are very seldom used, and the use of standard German is largely restricted to the written language.
Therefore, this situation has been called a medial diglossia.
Swiss Standard German is used in the Swiss education system.
Official status
Standard German is the only official language in Liechtenstein and Austria; it shares official status in Germany (with Danish, Frisian and Sorbian as minority languages), Switzerland (with French, Italian and Romansh), Belgium (with Dutch and French) and Luxembourg (with French and Luxembourgish).
It is used as a local official language in Italy (Province of Bolzano-Bozen), as well as in the cities of Sopron (Hungary), Krahule (Slovakia) and several cities in Romania.
It is the official language (with Italian) of the Vatican Swiss Guard.
German has an officially recognized status as regional or auxiliary language in Denmark (South Jutland region), France (Alsace and Moselle regions), Italy (Gressoney valley), Namibia, Poland (Opole region), and Russia (Asowo and Halbstadt).
German is one of the 23 official languages of the European Union.
It is the language with the largest number of native speakers in the European Union, and, shortly after English and long before French, the second-most spoken language in Europe.
German as a foreign language
German is the third most taught foreign language in the English speaking world after French and Spanish.
German is the main language of about 90–95 million people in Europe (as of 2004), or 13.3% of all Europeans, being the second most spoken native language in Europe after Russian, above French (66.5 million speakers in 2004) and English (64.2 million speakers in 2004).
It is therefore the most spoken first language in the EU.
It is the second most known foreign language in the EU.
It is one of the official languages of the European Union, and one of the three working languages of the European Commission, along with English and French.
Thirty-two percent of citizens of the EU-15 countries say they can converse in German (either as a mother tongue or as a second or foreign language).
This is assisted by the widespread availability of German TV by cable or satellite.
German was once, and still remains to some extent, a lingua franca in Central, Eastern and Northern Europe.
Dialects
German is a member of the western branch of the Germanic family of languages, which in turn is part of the Indo-European language family.
The German dialect continuum is traditionally divided most broadly into High German and Low German.
The variation among the German dialects is considerable, with only the neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible.
Some dialects are not intelligible to people who only know standard German.
However, all German dialects belong to the dialect continuum of High German and Low Saxon languages.
Until roughly the end of the Second World War, there was a dialect continuum of all the continental West Germanic languages because nearly any pair of neighbouring dialects were perfectly mutually intelligible.
Low German
Low Saxon varieties (spoken on German territory) are considered linguistically a language separate from the German language by some, but just a dialect by others.
Sometimes, Low Saxon and Low Franconian are grouped together because both are unaffected by the High German consonant shift.
However, the part of the population capable of speaking and responding to it, or of understanding it has decreased continuously since WWII.
Currently the effort to maintain a residual presence in cultural life is negligible.
Middle Low German was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League.
It was the predominant language in Northern Germany.
This changed in the 16th century.
In 1534 the Luther Bible by Martin Luther was printed.
This translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the Early New High German.
It aimed to be understandable to an ample audience and was based mainly on Central and Upper German varieties.
The Early New High German language gained more prestige than Low Saxon and became the language of science and literature.
Other factors were that around the same time, the Hanseatic league lost its importance as new trade routes to Asia and the Americas were established, and that the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.
The 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass education, the language of the schools being standard German.
Slowly Low Saxon was pushed back and back until it was nothing but a language spoken by the uneducated and at home.
Today Low Saxon can be divided in two groups: Low Saxon varieties with a reasonable standard German influx and varieties of Standard German with a Low Saxon influence known as Missingsch.
High German
High German is divided into Central German and Upper German.
Central German dialects include Ripuarian, Moselle Franconian, Hessian, Thuringian, South Franconian, Lorraine Franconian and Upper Saxon.
It is spoken in the southeastern Netherlands, eastern Belgium, Luxembourg, parts of France, and in Germany approximately between the River Main and the southern edge of the Lowlands.
Modern Standard German is mostly based on Central German, but it should be noted that the common (but not linguistically correct) German term for modern Standard German is Hochdeutsch, that is, High German.
The Moselle Franconian varieties spoken in Luxembourg have been officially standardised and institutionalised and are therefore usually considered a separate language known as Luxembourgish.
Upper German dialects include Alemannic (for instance Swiss German), Swabian, East Franconian, Alsatian and Austro-Bavarian.
They are spoken in parts of the Alsace, southern Germany, Liechtenstein, Austria, and in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland and Italy.
Wymysorys, Sathmarisch and Siebenbürgisch are High German dialects of Poland and Romania respectively.
The High German varieties spoken by Ashkenazi Jews (mostly in the former Soviet Union) have several unique features, and are usually considered as a separate language, Yiddish.
It is the only Germanic language that does not use the Latin alphabet as its standard script.
German dialects versus varieties of standard German
In German linguistics, German dialects are distinguished from varieties of standard German.
The German dialects are the traditional local varieties.
They are traditionally traced back to the different German tribes.
Many of them are hardly understandable to someone who knows only standard German, since they often differ from standard German in lexicon, phonology and syntax.
If a narrow definition of language based on mutual intelligibility is used, many German dialects are considered to be separate languages (for instance in the Ethnologue).
However, such a point of view is unusual in German linguistics.
The varieties of standard German refer to the different local varieties of the pluricentric standard German.
They only differ slightly in lexicon and phonology.
In certain regions, they have replaced the traditional German dialects, especially in Northern Germany.
Grammar
German is an inflected language.
Noun inflection
German nouns inflect into:
one of four cases: nominative, genitive, dative, and accusative.
one of three genders: masculine, feminine, or neuter.
Word endings sometimes reveal grammatical gender; for instance, nouns ending in ...ung(-ing), ...e,...schaft(-ship), ...keit or ...heit(-hood) are feminine, while nouns ending in ...chen or ...lein (diminutive forms) are neuter and nouns ending in ...ismus (-ism) are masculine.
Others are controversial, sometimes depending on the region in which it is spoken.
Additionally, ambiguous endings exist, such as ...er (-er), e.g. Feier (feminine), engl. celebration, party, and Arbeiter (masculine), engl. labourer.
Sentences can usually be reorganized to avoid a misunderstanding.
two numbers: singular and plural
Although German is usually cited as an outstanding example of a highly inflected language, the degree of inflection is considerably less than in Old German, or in other old Indo-European languages such as Latin, Ancient Greek, or Sanskrit.
The three genders have collapsed in the plural, which now behaves, grammatically, somewhat as a fourth gender.
With four cases and three genders plus plural there are 16 distinct possible combinations of case and gender/number, but presently there are only six forms of the definite article used for the 16 possibilities.
Inflection for case on the noun itself is required in the singular for strong masculine and neuter nouns in the genitive and sometimes in the dative.
Both of these cases are losing way to substitutes in informal speech.
The dative ending is considered somewhat old-fashioned in many contexts and often dropped, but it is still used in sayings and in formal speech or in written language.
Weak masculine nouns share a common case ending for genitive, dative and accusative in the singular.
Feminines are not declined in the singular.
The plural does have an inflection for the dative.
In total, seven inflectional endings (not counting plural markers) exist in German: -s, -es, -n, -ns, -en, -ens, -e.
In the German orthography, nouns and most words with the syntactical function of nouns are capitalised, which is supposed to make it easier for readers to find out what function a word has within the sentence (Am Freitag bin ich einkaufen gegangen. — "On Friday I went shopping."; Eines Tages war er endlich da. — "One day he finally showed up".)
This spelling convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related Luxemburgish language), although it was historically common in other languages (e.g., Danish and English), too.
Like most Germanic languages, German forms left-branching noun compounds, where the first noun modifies the category given by the second, for example: Hundehütte (eng. dog hut; specifically: doghouse).
Unlike English, where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in open form with separating spaces, German (like the other German languages) nearly always uses the closed form without spaces, for example: Baumhaus (eng. tree house).
Like English, German allows arbitrarily long compounds, but these are rare.
(See also English compounds.)
The longest German word verified to be actually in (albeit very limited) use is Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz. [which, literally translated, breaks up into: Rind (cattle) - Fleisch (meat) - Etikettierung(s) (labelling) - Überwachung(s) (supervision) - Aufgaben (duties) - Übertragung(s) (assignment) - Gesetz (law), so "Beef labelling supervision duty assignment law".]
Verb inflection
Standard German verbs inflect into:
one of two conjugation classes, weak and strong (like English).
(There is actually a third class, known as mixed verbs, which exhibit inflections combining features of both the strong and weak patterns.)
three persons: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
two numbers: singular and plural
three moods: Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative
two genera verbi: active and passive; the passive being composed and dividable into static and dynamic.
two non-composed tenses (present, preterite) and four composed tenses (perfect, pluperfect, future and future perfect)
distinction between grammatical aspects is rendered by combined use of subjunctive and/or preterite marking; thus: neither of both is plain indicative voice, sole subjunctive conveys second-hand information, subjunctive plus Preterite marking forms the conditional state, and sole preterite is either plain indicative (in the past), or functions as a (literal) alternative for either second-hand-information or for the conditional state of the verb, when one of them may seem indistinguishable otherwise.
distinction between perfect and progressive aspect is and has at every stage of development been at hand as a productive category of the older language and in nearly all documented dialects, but, strangely enough, is nowadays rigorously excluded from written usage in its present normalised form.
disambiguation of completed vs. uncompleted forms is widely observed and regularly generated by common prefixes (blicken - to look, erblicken - to see [unrelated form: sehen - to see]).
Verb prefixes
There are also many ways to expand, and sometimes radically change, the meaning of a base verb through a relatively small number of prefixes.
Some of those prefixes have a meaning themselves (Example: zer- refers to the destruction of things, as in zerreißen&nbsp;=&nbsp;to tear apart, zerbrechen&nbsp;=&nbsp;to break apart, zerschneiden&nbsp;=&nbsp;to cut apart), others do not have more than the vaguest meaning in and of themselves (Example: ver- , as in versuchen&nbsp;=&nbsp;to try, vernehmen&nbsp;=&nbsp;to interrogate, verteilen&nbsp;=&nbsp;to distribute, verstehen&nbsp;=&nbsp;to understand).
More examples: haften&nbsp;=&nbsp;to stick, verhaften&nbsp;=&nbsp;to imprison; kaufen&nbsp;=&nbsp;to buy, verkaufen&nbsp;=&nbsp;to sell; hören&nbsp;=&nbsp;to hear, aufhören&nbsp;=&nbsp;to cease; fahren&nbsp;=&nbsp;to drive, erfahren&nbsp;=&nbsp;to get to know, to hear about something.
Separable prefixes
Many German verbs have a separable prefix, often with an adverbial function.
In finite verb forms this is split off and moved to the end of the clause, and is hence considered by some to be a "resultative particle".
For example, mitgehen meaning "to go with" would be split giving Gehen Sie mit?
(Literal: "Go you with?" ; Formal: "Are you going along"?).
Indeed, several parenthetical clauses may occur between the prefix of a finite verb and its complement; e.g.
Er kam am Freitagabend nach einem harten Arbeitstag und dem üblichen Ärger, der ihn schon seit Jahren immer wieder an seinem Arbeitsplatz plagt, mit fraglicher Freude auf ein Mahl, das seine Frau ihm, wie er hoffte, bereits aufgetischt hatte, endlich zu Hause an .
A literal translation of this example might look like this:
He arr- on a Friday evening after a hard day at work and the usual disagreements that had been troubling him repeatedly, looking forward to a questionable meal which, as he hoped, his wife had already fixed for him, -ived at home.
Word order
German requires that a verbal element (main verb or auxiliary verb) appear second in the sentence, preceded by the most important topical phrase.
The second most important phrase appears at the end of the sentence.
For a sentence without an auxiliary, this gives several options:
<foreign/>
(The old man gives me the book today)
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
<foreign/> (stress on mir)
<foreign/> (as well)
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
The position of a noun as a subject or object in a German sentence doesn't affect the meaning of the sentence as it would in English.
In a declarative sentence in English if the subject does not occur before the predicate the sentence could well be misunderstood.
For example, in the sentence "Man bites dog" it is clear who did what to whom.
To exchange the place of the subject with that of the object — "Dog bites man" — changes the meaning completely.
In other words the word order in a sentence conveys significant information.
In German, nouns and articles are declined as in Latin thus indicating whether it is the subject or object of the verb's action.
The above example in German would be <foreign/> or <foreign/> with both having exactly the same meaning.
If the articles are omitted, which is sometimes done in headlines (<foreign/>), the syntax applies as in English — the first noun is the subject and the noun following the predicate is the object.
Except for emphasis, adverbs of time have to appear in the third place in the sentence, just after the predicate.
Otherwise the speaker would be recognised as non-German.
For instance the German word order (in Modern English) is: We're going tomorrow to town. (<foreign/>)
Auxiliary verbs
When an auxiliary verb is present, the auxiliary appears in second position, and the main verb appears at the end.
This occurs notably in the creation of the perfect tense.
Many word orders are still possible, e.g.:
<foreign/>
(The old man gave me the book yesterday.)
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
<foreign/>
The word order is generally less rigid than in Modern English except for nouns (see below).
There are two common word orders; one is for main clauses and another for subordinate clauses.
In normal positive sentences the inflected verb always has position 2; in questions, exclamations and wishes it always has position 1.
In subordinate clauses the verb is supposed to occur at the very end, but in speech this rule is often disregarded.
For example in a subordinate clause introduced by "weil" ("because") the verb quite often occupies the same order as in a main clause.
The correct way of saying "because I'm broke" is "<foreign/>".
In the vernacular you may hear instead "<foreign/>"
This phenomenon may be caused by mixing the word-order pattern used for the word <foreign/> with the pattern used for an alternative word for "because", <foreign/>, which is used with the main clause order ("<foreign/>").
Modal verbs
Sentences using modal verbs place the infinitive at the end.
For example, the sentence in Modern English "Should he go home?" would be rearranged in German to say "Should he (to) home go?" (<foreign/>).
Thus in sentences with several subordinate or relative clauses the infinitives are clustered at the end.
Compare the similar clustering of prepositions in the following English sentence: "What did you bring that book that I don't like to be read to out of up for?"
Multiple infinitives
The number of infinitives at the end is usually restricted to two, causing the third infinitive or auxiliary verb that would have gone at the very end to be placed instead at the beginning of the chain of verbs.
For example in the sentence "Should he move into the house that he just has had renovated?" would be rearranged to "Should he into the house move, that he just renovated had?".
(<foreign/>).
The older form would have been (<foreign/>).
If there are more than three infinitives, all except the first two are relocated to the beginning of the chain.
Needless to say the rule is not rigorously applied.
Vocabulary
Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family, although there are significant minorities of words derived from Latin, and Greek, and a smaller amount from French and most recently English .
At the same time, the effectiveness of the German language in forming equivalents for foreign words from its inherited Germanic stem repertory is great.
Thus, Notker Labeo was able to translate Aristotelian treatises in pure (Old High) German in the decades after the year 1000.
Overall, German has fewer Romance-language loanwords than does English.
The coining of new, autochthonous words gave German a vocabulary of an estimated 40,000 words as early as the ninth century.
In comparison, Latin, with a written tradition of nearly 2,500 years in an empire which ruled the Mediterranean, has grown to no more than 45,000 words today.
Even today, many low-key scholarly movements try to promote the Ersatz (substitution) of virtually all foreign words with ancient, dialectal, or neologous German alternatives.
It is claimed that this would also help in spreading modern or scientific notions among the less educated, and thus democratise public life, too.
Jurisprudence in Germany, for example, uses perhaps the "purest" tongue in terms of "Germanness", but also the most cumbersome, to be found today..
In the modern scientific German vocabulary data base in Leipzig (as of July 2003) there are nine million words and word groups in 35 million sentences (out of a corpus of 500 million words).
Writing system
Present
German is written using the Latin alphabet.
In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with Umlaut, namely ä, ö and ü, as well as the Eszett or scharfes s (sharp s), ß.
Before the German spelling reform of 1996, ß replaced ss after long vowels and diphthongs and before consonants, word-, or partial-word-endings.
In reformed spelling, ß replaces ss only after long vowels and diphthongs.
Since there is no capital ß, it is always written as SS when capitalization is required.
For example, Maßband (tape measure) is capitalized MASSBAND.
An exception is the use of ß in legal documents and forms when capitalizing names.
To avoid confusion with similar names, a "ß" is to be used instead of "SS".
(So: "KREßLEIN" instead of "KRESSLEIN".)
A capital ß has been proposed and included in Unicode, but it is not yet recognized as standard German.
In Switzerland, ß is not used at all.
Umlaut vowels (ä, ö, ü) are commonly circumscribed with ae, oe, and ue if the umlauts are not available on the keyboard used.
In the same manner ß can be circumscribed as ss. German readers understand those circumscriptions (although they look unusual), but they are avoided if the regular umlauts are available because they are considered a makeshift, not proper spelling.
(In Westphalia, city and family names exist where the extra e has a vowel lengthening effect, e.g. Raesfeld [ˈraːsfɛlt] and Coesfeld [ˈkoːsfɛlt], but this use of the letter e after a/o/u does not occur in the present-day spelling of words other than proper nouns.
)
Unfortunately there is still no general agreement exactly where these umlauts occur in the sorting sequence.
Telephone directories treat them by replacing them with the base vowel followed by an e, whereas dictionaries use just the base vowel.
As an example in a telephone book Ärzte occurs after Adressenverlage but before Anlagenbauer (because Ä is replaced by Ae).
In a dictionary Ärzte occurs after Arzt but before Asbest (because Ä is treated as A).
In some older dictionaries or indexes, initial Sch and St are treated as separate letters and are listed as separate entries after S.
Past
Until the early 20th century, German was mostly printed in blackletter typefaces (mostly in Fraktur, but also in Schwabacher) and written in corresponding handwriting (for example Kurrent and Sütterlin).
These variants of the Latin alphabet are very different from the serif or sans serif Antiqua typefaces used today, and particularly the handwritten forms are difficult for the untrained to read.
The printed forms however were claimed by some to be actually more readable when used for printing Germanic languages .
The Nazis initially promoted Fraktur and Schwabacher since they were considered Aryan, although they later abolished them in 1941 by claiming that these letters were Jewish.
The latter fact is not widely known anymore; today the letters are often associated with the Nazis and are no longer commonly used .
The Fraktur script remains present in everyday life through road signs, pub signs, beer brands and other forms of advertisement, where it is used to convey a certain rusticality and oldness.
A proper use of the long s, (langes s), ſ, is essential to write German text in Fraktur typefaces.
Many Antiqua typefaces include the long s, also.
A specific set of rules applies for the use of long s in German text, but it is rarely used in Antiqua typesetting, recently.
Any lower case "s" at the beginning of a syllable would be a long s, as opposed to a terminal s or short s (the more common variation of the letter s), which marks the end of a syllable; for example, in differentiating between the words Wachſtube (=guard-house) and Wachstube (=tube of floor polish).
One can decide which "s" to use by appropriate hyphenation, easily ("Wach-ſtube" vs. "Wachs-tube").
The long s only appears in lower case.
The widespread ignorance of the correct use of the Fraktur scripts shows however in the many mistakes made&mdash; such as the frequent erroneous use of the round s instead of the long s at the beginning of a syllable, the failure to employ the mandatory ligatures of Fraktur, or the use of letter-forms more alike to the Antiqua for certain especially hard-to-read Fraktur letters.
Phonology
Vowels
German vowels (excluding diphthongs; see below) come in short and long varieties, as detailed in the following table:
Short <ipa/> is realised as <ipa/> in stressed syllables (including secondary stress), but as <ipa/> in unstressed syllables.
Note that stressed short <ipa/> can be spelled either with e or with ä (hätte 'would have' and Kette 'chain', for instance, rhyme).
In general, the short vowels are open and the long vowels are closed.
The one exception is the open <ipa/> sound of long Ä; in some varieties of standard German, <ipa/> and <ipa/> have merged into <ipa/>, removing this anomaly.
In that case, pairs like Bären/Beeren 'bears/berries' or Ähre/Ehre 'spike/honour' become homophonous).
In many varieties of standard German, an unstressed <ipa/> is not pronounced as <ipa/>, but vocalised to <ipa/>.
Whether any particular vowel letter represents the long or short phoneme is not completely predictable, although the following regularities exist:
If a vowel (other than i) is at the end of a syllable or followed by a single consonant, it is usually pronounced long (e.g. Hof [hoːf]).
If the vowel is followed by a double consonant (e.g. ff, ss or tt), ck, tz or a consonant cluster (e.g. st or nd), it is nearly always short (e.g. hoffen [ˈhɔfǝn]).
Double consonants are used only for this function of marking preciding vowels as short; the consonant itself is never pronounced lengthened or doubled.
Both of these rules have exceptions (e.g. hat [hat] 'has' is short despite the first rule; Kloster <ipa/>, 'cloister'; Mond <ipa/>, 'moon' are long despite the second rule).
For an i that is neither in the combination ie (making it long) nor followed by a double consonant or cluster (making it short), there is no general rule.
In some cases, there are regional differences: In central Germany (Hessen), the o in the proper name "Hoffmann" is pronounced long while most other Germans would pronounce it short; the same applies to the e in the geographical name "Mecklenburg" for people in that region.
The word Städte 'cities', is pronounced with a short vowel <ipa/> by some (Jan Hofer, ARD Television) and with a long vowel <ipa/> by others (Marietta Slomka, ZDF Television).
Finally, a vowel followed by ch can be short (Fach <ipa/> 'compartment', Küche <ipa/> 'kitchen') or long (Suche <ipa/> 'search', Bücher <ipa/> 'books') almost at random.
Thus, Lache is homographous: <ipa/> 'puddle' and <ipa/> 'manner of laughing' (coll.), 'laugh!'
(Imp.).
German vowels can form the following digraphs (in writing) and diphthongs (in pronunciation); note that the pronunciation of some of them (ei, äu, eu) is very different from what one would expect when considering the component letters:
Additionally, the digraph ie generally represents the phoneme <ipa/>, which is not a diphthong.
In many varieties, a /r/ at the end of a syllable is vocalised.
However, a sequence of a vowel followed by such a vocalised /r/ is not considered a diphthong: Bär <ipa/> 'bear', er <ipa/> 'he', wir <ipa/> 'we', Tor <ipa/> 'gate', kurz <ipa/> 'short', Wörter <ipa/> 'words'.
In most varieties of standard German, word stems that begin with a vowel are preceded by a glottal stop [ʔ].
Consonants
c standing by itself is not a German letter.
In borrowed words, it is usually pronounced [ʦ] (before ä, äu, e, i, ö, ü, y) or [k] (before a, o, u, or before consonants).
The combination ck is, as in English, used to indicate that the preceding vowel is short.
ch occurs most often and is pronounced either [ç] (after ä, ai, äu, e, ei, eu, i, ö, ü and after consonants) or [x] (after a, au, o, u).
Ch never occurs at the beginning of an originally German word.
In borrowed words with initial Ch there is no single agreement on the pronunciation.
For example, the word "Chemie" (chemistry) can be pronounced [keːˈmiː], [çeːˈmiː] or [ʃeːˈmiː] depending on dialect.
dsch is pronounced ʤ (like j in Jungle) but appears in a few loanwords only.
f is pronounced [f] as in "father".
h is pronounced [h] like in "home" at the beginning of a syllable.
After a vowel it is silent and only lengthens the vowel (e.g. "Reh" = roe deer).
j is pronounced [j] in Germanic words ("Jahr" [jaːɐ]).
In younger loanwords, it follows more or less the respective languages' pronunciations.
l is always pronounced [l], never [ɫ] (the English "Dark L").
q only exists in combination with u and appears both in Germanic and Latin words ("quer"; "Qualität").
It is pronounced [kv].
r is pronounced as a guttural sound (an uvular trill, [ʀ]) in front of a vowel or consonant ("Rasen" [ʀaːzən]; "Burg" like [buʀg]).
In spoken German however, it is commonly vocalised after a vowel ("er" being pronounced rather like ['ɛɐ] - "Burg" [buɐg]).
In some southern non-standard varieties, the r is pronounced as a tongue-tip r (the alveolar trill).
s in Germany, is pronounced [z] (as in "Zebra") if it forms the syllable onset (e.g. Sohn [zoːn]), otherwise [s] (e.g. Bus [bʊs]).
In Austria, always pronounced [s].
A ss [s] indicates that the preceding vowel is short. st and sp at the beginning of words of German origin are pronounced [ʃt] and [ʃp], respectively.
ß (a letter unique to German called "Esszet") was a ligature of a double s and of a sz and is always pronounced [s].
Originating in Blackletter typeface, it traditionally replaced ss at the end of a syllable (e.g. "ich muss" → "ich muß"; "ich müsste" → "ich müßte"); within a word it contrasts with ss [s] in indicating that the preceding vowel is long (compare "in Maßen" [in 'maːsən] "with moderation" and "in Massen" [in 'masən] "in loads").
The use of ß has recently been limited by the latest German spelling reform and is no longer used for ss at the end of a syllable; Switzerland and Liechtenstein already abolished it in 1934.
sch is pronounced [ʃ] (like "sh" in "Shine").
v is pronounced [f] in words of Germanic origin (e.g. "Vater" [ˈfaːtɐ]) and [v] in most other words (e.g. "Vase" [ˈvaːzǝ]).
w is pronounced [v] like in "vacation" (e.g. "was" [vas]).
y only appears in loanwords and is traditionally considered a vowel.
z is always pronounced [ʦ] (e.g. "zog" [ʦoːk]).
A tz indicates that the preceding vowel is short.
Consonant shifts
German does not have any dental fricatives (as English th).
The th sounds, which the English language has inherited from Anglo Saxon, survived on the continent up to Old High German and then disappeared in German with the consonant shifts between the 8th and the 10th century.
It is sometimes possible to find parallels between German by replacing the English th with d in German: "Thank" → in German "Dank", "this" and "that" → "dies" and "das", "thou" (old 2nd person singular pronoun) → "du", "think" → "denken", "thirsty" → "durstig" and many other examples.
Likewise, the gh in Germanic English words, pronounced in several different ways in modern English (as an f, or not at all), can often be linked to German ch: "to laugh" → "lachen", "through" and "thorough" → "durch", "high" → "hoch", "naught" → "nichts", etc.
Cognates with English
There are many thousands of German words that are cognate to English words (in fact a sizeable fraction of native German and English vocabulary, although for various reasons much of it is not immediately obvious).
Most of the words in the following table have almost the same meaning as in English.
Compound word cognates
When these cognates have slightly different consonants, this is often due to the High German consonant shift.
Hence the affinity of English words with those of German dialects is more evidently:
There are cognates whose meanings in either language have changed through the centuries.
It is sometimes difficult for both English and German speakers to discern the relationship.
On the other hand, once the definitions are made clear, then the logical relation becomes obvious.
Sometimes the generality or specificity of word pairs may be opposite in the two languages.
German and English also share many borrowings from other languages, especially Latin, French and Greek.
Most of these words have the same meaning, while a few have subtle differences in meaning.
As many of these words have been borrowed by numerous languages, not only German and English, they are called internationalisms in German linguistics.
For reference, a good number of these borrowed words are of the neuter gender.
Words borrowed by English

In the English language, there are also many words taken from German without any letter change, e.g.:

The names that countries have for the language differ from region to region.
In Italian the sole name for German is still tedesco, from the Latin theodiscus, meaning "vernacular".
A possible explanation for the use of words meaning "mute" (e.g., nemoj in Russian, němý in Czech, nem in Serbian) to refer to German (and also to Germans) in Slavic languages is that Germans were the first people Slavic tribes encountered with whom they could not communicate.
Romanian used to use the Slavonic term "nemţeşte", but "germană" is now widely used.
Hungarian "német" is also of Slavonic origin.
The Arabic name for Austria, النمسا ("an-namsa"), is derived from the Slavonic term.
Note also that though the Russian term for the language is немецкий (nemetskij), the country is Германия (Germania).
However, in certain other Slavic languages, such as Czech, the country name (Německo) is similar to the name of the language, německý (jazyk).
Finns and Estonians use the term saksa, originally from the Saxon tribe.
Scandinavians use derivatives of the word Tyskland/Þýskaland (from Theodisca) for the country and tysk(a)/þýska for the language.
Hebrew traditionally (nowadays this is not the case) used the Biblical term אַשְׁכֲּנָז (Ashkenaz) (Genesis 10:3) to refer to Germany, or to certain parts of it, and the Ashkenazi Jews are those who originate from Germany and Eastern Europe and formerly spoke Yiddish as their native language, derived from Middle High German.
Modern Hebrew uses גֶּרְמָנִי germaní (Or גֶּרְמָנִית germanít for the language).
The French term is allemand, the Spanish term is alemán, the Catalan term is alemany, and the Portuguese term is alemão; all derive from the ancient Alamanni tribal alliance, meaning literally "All Men".
The Latvian term vācu means "tinny" and refers disparagingly to the iron-clad Teutonic Knights that colonized the Baltic in the Middle Ages.
The Scottish Gaelic term for the German language, Gearmailtis, is formed in the standard way of adding -(a)is to the end of the country name.
See Names for Germany for further details on the origins of these and other terms.
GNU General Public License
The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or simply GPL) is a widely used free software license, originally written by Richard Stallman for the GNU project.
The GPL is the most popular and well-known example of the type of strong copyleft license that requires derived works to be available under the same copyleft.
Under this philosophy, the GPL is said to grant the recipients of a computer program the rights of the free software definition and uses copyleft to ensure the freedoms are preserved, even when the work is changed or added to.
This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses are the standard examples.
The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a modified, more permissive, version of the GPL, originally intended for some software libraries.
There is also a GNU Free Documentation License, which was originally intended for use with documentation for GNU software, but has also been adopted for other uses, such as the Wikipedia project.
The Affero General Public License (GNU AGPL) is a similar license with a focus on networking server software.
The GNU AGPL is similar to the GNU General Public License, except that it additionally covers the use of the software over a computer network, requiring that the complete source code be made available to any network user of the AGPLed work, for example a web application.
The Free Software Foundation recommends that this license is considered for any software that will commonly be run over the network.
History
The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989 for use with programs released as part of the GNU project.
The original GPL was based on a unification of similar licenses used for early versions of GNU Emacs, the GNU Debugger and the GNU Compiler Collection.
These licenses contained similar provisions to the modern GPL, but were specific to each program, rendering them incompatible, despite being the same license.
Stallman's goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code.
An important vote of confidence in the GPL came from Linus Torvalds' adoption of the license for the Linux kernel in 1992, switching from an earlier license that prohibited commercial distribution.
As of August 2007, the GPL accounted for nearly 65% of the 43,442 free software projects listed on Freshmeat, and as of January 2006, about 68% of the projects listed on SourceForge.net.
Similarly, a 2001 survey of Red Hat Linux 7.1 found that 50% of the source code was licensed under the GPL and a 1997 survey of MetaLab, then the largest free software archive, showed that the GPL accounted for about half of the licenses used.
One survey of a large repository of open-source software reported that in July 1997, about half the software packages with explicit license terms used the GPL.
Prominent free software programs licensed under the GPL include the Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).
Some other free software programs are dual-licensed under multiple licenses, often with one of the licenses being the GPL.
Some observers believe that the strong copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux, giving the programmers who contributed to it the confidence that their work would benefit the whole world and remain free, rather than being exploited by software companies that would not have to give anything back to the community.
The second version of the license, version 2, was released in 1991.
Over the following 15 years, some members of the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) community came to believe that some software and hardware vendors were finding loopholes in the GPL, allowing GPL-licensed software to be exploited in ways that were contrary to the intentions of the programmers.
These concerns included tivoization (the inclusion of GPL-licensed software in hardware that will refuse to run modified versions of its software); the use of unpublished, modified versions of GPL software behind web interfaces; and patent deals between Microsoft and Linux and Unix distributors that may represent an attempt to use patents as a weapon against competition from Linux.
Version 3 was developed to attempt to address these concerns.
It was officially released on June 29, 2007.
Versions
Version 1
Version 1 of the GNU GPL, released in January 1989, prevented what were then the two main ways that software distributors restricted the freedoms that define free software.
The first problem was that distributors may publish binary files only – executable, but not readable or modifiable by humans.
To prevent this, GPLv1 said that any vendor distributing binaries must also make the human readable source code available under the same licensing terms.
The second problem was the distributors might add additional restrictions, either by adding restrictions to the license, or by combining the software with other software which had other restrictions on its distribution.
If this was done, then the union of the two sets of restrictions would apply to the combined work, thus unacceptable restrictions could be added.
To prevent this, GPLv1 said that modified versions, as a whole, had to be distributed under the terms in GPLv1.
Therefore, software distributed under the terms of GPLv1 could be combined with software under more permissive terms, as this would not change the terms under which the whole could be distributed, but software distributed under GPLv1 could not be combined with software distributed under a more restrictive license, as this would conflict with the requirement that the whole be distributable under the terms of GPLv1.
Version 2
According to Richard Stallman, the major change in GPLv2 was the "Liberty or Death" clause, as he calls it - Section 7.
This section says that if someone has restrictions imposed that prevent him or her from distributing GPL-covered software in a way that respects other users' freedom (for example, if a legal ruling states that he or she can only distribute the software in binary form), he or she cannot distribute it at all.
By 1990, it was becoming apparent that a less restrictive license would be strategically useful for some software libraries; when version 2 of the GPL (GPLv2) was released in June 1991, therefore, a second license - the Library General Public License (LGPL) was introduced at the same time and numbered with version 2 to show that both were complementary.
The version numbers diverged in 1999 when version 2.1 of the LGPL was released, which renamed it the GNU Lesser General Public License to reflect its place in the GNU philosophy.
Version 3
In late 2005, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) announced work on version 3 of the GPL (GPLv3).
On January 16, 2006, the first "discussion draft" of GPLv3 was published, and the public consultation began.
The public consultation was originally planned for nine to fifteen months but finally stretched to eighteen months with four drafts being published.
The official GPLv3 was released by FSF on June 29, 2007.
GPLv3 was written by Richard Stallman, with legal counsel from Eben Moglen and Software Freedom Law Center.
According to Stallman, the most important changes are in relation to software patents, free software license compatibility, the definition of "source code", and hardware restrictions on software modification ("tivoization").
Other changes relate to internationalisation, how license violations are handled, and how additional permissions can be granted by the copyright holder.
Other notable changes include allowing authors to add certain additional conditions or requirements to their contributions.
One of those new optional requirements, sometimes referred to as the Affero clause, is intended to fulfill a request regarding software as a service; the permitting addition of this requirement makes GPLv3 compatible with the Affero General Public License.
The public consultation process was coordinated by the Free Software Foundation with assistance from Software Freedom Law Center, Free Software Foundation Europe, and other free software groups.
Comments were collected from the public via the gplv3.fsf.org web portal.
That portal runs purpose-written software called stet.
These comments were passed to four committees comprising approximately 130 people, including supporters and detractors of FSF's goals.
Those committees researched the comments submitted by the public and passed their summaries to Stallman for a decision on what the license would do.
During the public consultation process, 962 comments were submitted for the first draft.
By the end, a total of 2,636 comments had been submitted.
The third draft was released on March 28, 2007.
This draft included language intended to prevent patent cross-licenses like the controversial Microsoft-Novell patent agreement and restricts the anti-tivoization clauses to a legal definition of a "User" or "consumer product."
It also explicitly removed the section on "Geographical Limitations", whose probable removal had been announced at the launch of the public consultation.
The fourth discussion draft, which was the last, was released on May 31, 2007.
It introduced Apache Software License compatibility, clarified the role of outside contractors, and made an exception to permit the Microsoft-Novell agreement, saying in section 11 paragraph 6 that
This aims to make future such deals ineffective.
The license is also meant to cause Microsoft to extend the patent licenses it grants to Novell customers for the use of GPLv3 software to all users of that GPLv3 software; this is possible only if Microsoft is legally a "conveyor" of the GPLv3 software.
Others, notably some high-profile developers of the Linux kernel, commented to the mass media and made public statements about their objections to parts of discussion drafts 1 and 2.
Terms and conditions
The terms and conditions of the GPL are available to anybody receiving a copy of the work that has a GPL applied to it ("the licensee").
Any licensee who adheres to the terms and conditions is given permission to modify the work, as well as to copy and redistribute the work or any derivative version.
The licensee is allowed to charge a fee for this service, or do this free of charge.
This latter point distinguishes the GPL from software licenses that prohibit commercial redistribution.
The FSF argues that free software should not place restrictions on commercial use, and the GPL explicitly states that GPL works may be sold at any price.
The GPL additionally states that a distributor may not impose "further restrictions on the rights granted by the GPL".
This forbids activities such as distributing of the software under a non-disclosure agreement or contract.
Distributors under the GPL also grant a license for any of their patents practiced by the software, to practice those patents in GPL software.
Section three of the license requires that programs distributed as pre-compiled binaries are accompanied by a copy of the source code, a written offer to distribute the source code via the same mechanism as the pre-compiled binary or the written offer to obtain the source code that you got when you received the pre-compiled binary under the GPL.
Copyleft
The distribution rights granted by the GPL for modified versions of the work are not unconditional.
When someone distributes a GPL'd work plus their own modifications, the requirements for distributing the whole work cannot be any greater than the requirements that are in the GPL.
This requirement is known as copyleft.
It earns its legal power from the use of copyright on software programs.
Because a GPL work is copyrighted, a licensee has no right to redistribute it, not even in modified form (barring fair use), except under the terms of the license.
One is only required to adhere to the terms of the GPL if one wishes to exercise rights normally restricted by copyright law, such as redistribution.
Conversely, if one distributes copies of the work without abiding by the terms of the GPL (for instance, by keeping the source code secret), he or she can be sued by the original author under copyright law.
Copyleft thus uses copyright law to accomplish the opposite of its usual purpose: instead of imposing restrictions, it grants rights to other people, in a way that ensures the rights cannot subsequently be taken away.
It also ensures that unlimited redistribution rights are not granted, should any legal flaw (or "bug") be found in the copyleft statement.
Many distributors of GPL'ed programs bundle the source code with the executables.
An alternative method of satisfying the copyleft is to provide a written offer to provide the source code on a physical medium (such as a CD) upon request.
In practice, many GPL'ed programs are distributed over the Internet, and the source code is made available over FTP.
For Internet distribution, this complies with the license.
Copyleft applies only when a person seeks to redistribute the program.
One is allowed to make private modified versions, without any obligation to divulge the modifications as long as the modified software is not distributed to anyone else.
Note that the copyleft applies only to the software and not to its output (unless that output is itself a derivative work of the program); for example, a public web portal running a modified derivative of a GPL'ed content management system is not required to distribute its changes to the underlying software.
Licensing and contractual issues
The GPL was designed as a license, rather than a contract.
In some Common Law jurisdictions, the legal distinction between a license and a contract is an important one: contracts are enforceable by contract law, whereas licenses are enforced under copyright law.
However, this distinction is not useful in the many jurisdictions where there are no differences between contracts and licenses, such as Civil Law systems.
Those who do not agree to the GPL's terms and conditions do not have permission, under copyright law, to copy or distribute GPL licensed software or derivative works.
However, they may still use the software however they like.
Copyright holders
The text of the GPL is itself copyrighted, and the copyright is held by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
However, the FSF does not hold the copyright for a work released under the GPL, unless an author explicitly assigns copyrights to the FSF (which seldom happens except for programs that are part of the GNU project).
Only the individual copyright holders have the authority to sue when a license violation takes place.
The FSF permits people to create new licenses based on the GPL, as long as the derived licenses do not use the GPL preamble without permission.
This is discouraged, however, since such a license is generally incompatible with the GPL.
(See the GPL FAQ for more information.)
Other licenses created by the GNU project include the GNU Lesser General Public License and the GNU Free Documentation License.
The GPL in court
A key dispute related to the GPL is whether or not non-GPL software can dynamically link to GPL libraries.
The GPL is clear in requiring that all derivative works of GPL'ed code must themselves be GPL'ed.
However, it is not clear whether an executable that dynamically links to a GPL code should be considered a derivative work.
The free/open-source software community is split on this issue.
The FSF asserts that such an executable is indeed a derivative work if the executable and GPL code "make function calls to each other and share data structures," with others agreeing, while some (e.g. Linus Torvalds) agree that dynamic linking can create derived works but disagree over the circumstances.
On the other hand, some experts have argued that the question is still open: one Novell lawyer has written that dynamic linking not being derivative "makes sense" but is not "clear-cut," and Lawrence Rosen has claimed that a court of law would "probably" exclude dynamic linking from derivative works although "there are also good arguments" on the other side and "the outcome is not clear" (on a later occasion, he argued that "market-based" factors are more important than the linking technique).
This is ultimately a question not of the GPL per se, but of how copyright law defines derivative works.
In Galoob v. Nintendo the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals defined a derivative work as having "'form' or permanence" and noted that "the infringing work must incorporate a portion of the copyrighted work in some form," but there have been no clear court decisions to resolve this particular conflict.
