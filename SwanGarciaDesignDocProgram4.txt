The pseudocode bellow will work by adding the test inputs to the layers. Weight[i] is the weight between i in the test layer and layer that is trying to be found. There is also a bias that is added to all of the test inputs.  

for( i = 1; i <= testNum; i++ ) {         
Bias[j] += testInput[i] * Weight[i][j] ;          
}

Bellow will convert the separation curve/line that will separate the two parts.
Layer[j] = 1.0/(1.0 + exp(-Bias[j])); 

The pseudocode bellow implements a weight matrix that will need to be added to show the different layers. Also the dot product is also implements in the code bellow.

for( j = 1 ; j <= numLayer ; j++ ) {         
Bias[j] = Weight[0][j] ;
for( i = 1 ; i <= testInput ; i++ ) {
Bias[j] += Input[i] * Weight[i][j] ; // dot product
}
Layer[j] = 1.0/(1.0 + exp(-Bias[j])) ;
}

for( k = 1 ; k <= Output ; k++ ) {         
Bias2[k] = Weight2[0][k] ;
for( j = 1 ; j <= numLayer ; j++ ) {
Bias2[k] += Layer[j] * Weight2[j][k] ; 
}
finalOut[k] = 1.0/(1.0 + exp(-Bias2[k])) ;
}

For the implementation of prediction, I will try to implement by using the following pseudocode.
if ((n == -1 && y >= 0.0 ) || ( n == 1 y <= 0.0)){
	++Wrong;
}Else
	++Correct;
}

The learned category W•X >  0 will be implemented something similar to the bellow
pseudocode. Below is the back-propagation pseudocode. This creates another matrix but when this is actually implemented into code, I will combine the weight matrix about with the matrix bellow. For now, this is just a step by step logic of each snippet. 

Backprop(void) {
for (i = 0; i < Layer; i++) {
changeWeight = logisticRegression2 * 0.0 * Bias[i]orLayer[i];
	Weight2[j] = changeWeight;

if (Weight2[j] < 0) {
	Weight2[j] = -1;
} else 
Weight2[j] = 1;
}
}
After the back propagation is done then the weight(s) will have to be updated between the layers.

There will also be the standard way to read the file inputs. From there I will use XOR to output the target output by using 0 XOR 0 = 0, 1 XOR 1 = 0, 0 XOR 1 = 1 and 1 XOR 0 = 1. This will be used for the binary non linear MLP.

The Label in the test files will be the “y” target. 

I did not put the pseudo code but there will also be a way to read in the test files and output results to a text file as well.
